        <h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            It is comprehensible that large institutions lose track of their employees' complete expertise – besides the expertise implied by their working titles. For instance, a professor in mathematics – surveyed as a mathematician – could be doing researching on optimal irradiation dosage for aneuploid cancer progression in young breast cancer patients. In this case, oncologists would be a more suitable description of the professor's expertise (at least as a complement to mathematics). The lack of accurate and holistic representation of researchers complicates social networking and hence aggravate research. One problem of this kind is to become able to discriminate and find all researchers within the life sciences at KTH, which is the focus of this research.
        </p>
        <p>
            Retrospectively, there has not been any self-evident approach to solve this problem. The most straightforward approach would likely be to ask the researchers to answer a survey for an update periodically. However, given that they even reply, the effort put in to answer would likely in many cases be limited with quality problems. A second contrived approach would be to let a clerk read through a myriad of articles to classify the authors. However, this would be very time-consuming, tedious, and non-automatic.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Neither of the mentioned approaches is tempting; nevertheless, the latter option is adopted in this research, but with one crucial difference, replacing the clerk with a computer and software – i.e., utilizing artificial intelligence. More specifically, natural language understanding will be the foundation of this work, and contemporary techniques facilitate the collection of contextually similar articles. Moreover, by ocular inspection of a small fraction - 1% of the total articles - the rest of the articles - more than 20 thousand – can be classified with more than 95% accuracy. Hence, the approach avoids an immense workload, as well as accomplishing a quick, reproducible, and accurate method.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In this particular project, only the abstract of the article is adopted to increase efficiency. The vocabulary (all unique words observed in the collection of articles) amounts to approximately 61 thousand words, with 24 thousand articles and 7 thousand authors.

            The figure above demonstrates the distribution of life science authors when only considering the department that hired them. There are five different departments and 884 authors. As will be demonstrated in chapter 4, the representation, in this case, is far from reality and also somewhat misleading.

        <h1>Chapter 2: Natural Language Processing</h1>
        <p>
            The first step is to use natural language processing, and more specifically, the doc2vec algorithm, which is a technique to represent words, articles, and the authors as vectors. Ostensibly, employing the author-vectors for further classification would be the best approach. Nonetheless, this approach has some severe drawback as opposed to the articles-vector. The reason is that the author-vectors can only have one specific location, while the articles they participate in can be distinctive. To clarify, when training the vectors, different subjects (e.g., mechanics, bioinformatics, plasma physics, etc.) will occupy different regions in space, where domain-specific words, articles, and authors exist. As a consequence, if a researcher works in three distinct areas, say biology, plasma physics, and aerodynamics, and the author-vector is applied, the locations of the researcher would occur at one of these regions whereas using the articles-vector, will propagate the researcher to all three regions. Hence, it is easier to distribute an author with his/her corresponding article-vectors, which, therefore, will provide a more accurate description of any given researcher. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The doc2vec model used is "Distributed bag of words," and the specification of the hyper-parameters used is as follows: vector dimension of 500, window-size of 10 and trained for 7000 epochs. The paragraph vectors are restricted to articles-ids since the author vector has no downstream application; hence, minimizing the number of vectors to train and by that reducing the risks to disturb the overall training.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/trainingDoc2vec.png">
        <p>
            The figure above is a small example of the idea of doc2vec. In this example, there are two researchers, i.e., researcher A and B. Researcher A is a researcher in life science and has written an article with doc-id: LS100, which is about dog forensics. Researcher B is a mathematician who has written an article about Gauge theory with doc-id: M500. To the left, there are two article vectors (M500 and LS100) and two-word vectors (Dogs and Addition). Furthermore, as a first step, these vectors are randomly initiated in three dimensions. Without going into all the details, the doc2vec algorithm function aims to adjust the vectors, so the related items are close to each other in vector space (i.e., articleM500 to the word addition, and article LS100 to the word dogs), see the right side of the figure. Now it is possible to compare closeness between words and articles, and this fact is leveraged in the continued work.

        <h1>Chapter 3: Data Selection</h1>
        <p>
            The data adopted for the model has to be carefully selected; otherwise, overfitting is inevitable. For example, just randomly picking articles would be devastating. The logic is that some subjects are more popular than others, and consequently, some regions in space will be denser. By randomly picking articles, it is more probable to pick articles in the dense regions, this, in conjunction with the desire to use a minimal number of points adopted (to reduce labor i.e., the need to read one abstract for each point), leads to undiscovered regions – i.e., a recipe for overfitting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, it would be the worst type of overfitting, even if hedging with a test and validation set would suffer from the same problem as the train set. By using the accuracy of the test/validation set as a guide for performance, even if good, is merely a mirage, which would lead to a disappointing end-product as the final result. The solution to this conundrum is to obtain a more comprehensive dataset. In this case, the selection-schema used to pursue the demanded heterogeneity can be described as follows: Cluster the data to get a rough representation of the location of data, and then allot few data-points from each cluster to train/test/validate dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
            The clustering method used was variation Bayesian Gaussian mixture models with 250 number of clusters. 
        </p>
        <img id="distImg" src="./assets/images/DistributionClusters.png" alt="">     

        <p>
            The figure above illustrates the distribution of the life science articles in the different clusters. Imagine now to skip this step and, instead, randomly pick articles from the training/testing/validation set. A probable outcome would be that the set would mainly constitute of articles from cluster 131, 154, and 206, and hence with less representation (if any) from the smaller cluster – i.e., resulting in very homogenous datasets; requiring the model to extrapolate too much. Instead, by systematically picking a few data points from each cluster forces the datasets to be more heterogeneous, and hence, overfitting will be less of a problem.
        </p>

        <p>
            When labeling the data, a clear definition of life science has to be implemented to avoid any ambiguities. Definition of life science:
        </p>
        <li>
            The life science or biological sciences comprise the branches of science that involve the scientific study of life and organisms – such as microorganisms, plants, and animal, including human beings. 
        </li>
    </div>

        <h1>Chapter 4: Classification</h1>
        <p>
            Only using 1% of the data appears precarious, but, in fact, this spare set serves only as a basis for the accumulation of new data, and it is because semi-supervised learning is adopted. Here is a brief description of the method used: Start the procedure by initiate training of a model with the small dataset – the teacher model. After that, use the teacher model to make predictions on the rest of the unlabeled data and join the most confident predictions to the training set. Finally, a second model – the student model – trains on the extended data set – i.e., the teacher teaches the student. Additionally, this approach can be re-iterated (either by depletion of unlabeled data or trivially terminate the algorithm), where the student becomes the teacher for each new iteration – i.e., make predictions of remaining unlabeled dataset (those with too low confidence in previous iterations) for further addition of data-points to the dataset. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The data split-paradigm for the train/test/validation set is the 6:3:1 ratio, i.e., for every ten samples, for each cluster, six data points goes to the training set, three to the validation set, and one to the test set. Generally, an 8:1:1 split is the most common in machine learning of equal data size. However, since semi-supervised learning is adopted, and the test accuracy will be used as a threshold for reject/accept of unlabeled data, the test-data must not become biased. One of the easiest ways to avoid bias, in this case, is to have a larger test-sample.
        </p>
        <p>
            To accept a data point from the unlabeled dataset, and therefore add it to the training data, the following condition has to be satisfied: The test accuracy when training the model with that datapoint must at least be as good as the previous best test accuracy without that particular data point.
        </p>

        <p>
            The model used is Naive Bayes, and the semi-supervised learning ran until there were no more unlabeled data left. With the final accuracy of ~95% of the validation set.

        <p>
            Recall the distribution in chapter 1; the outcome is quite different two ways: diversity and a total number of authors. The method suggests a vast diversity within life science – 34 additional (39 in total)  departments. It also suggests the research within life science is more massive than observed on its surface – almost twice as many (1744 in total) authors. Both these results might seem astounding, but the "Search application" on next page is quite persuasive.
