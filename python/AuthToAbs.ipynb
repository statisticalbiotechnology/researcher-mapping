The mechanisms behind the enhanced water dissociation are poorly understood and therefore a semi-empirical approach is suggested. The enhanced water dissociation is introduced as a heterogeneous surface reaction similar to the well established Butler-“Volmer law for electrode reactions. In the model there are two parameters that need to be determined through experiments. A 1D diffusion boundary layer problem is presented and solved in order to show that a sufficient rate of water dissociation can be obtained with the model. The advantage of the presented model is that it can easily be incorporated into simulations of electromembrane processes such as electrodialysis, electrodeionization and electropermutation. The influence of the enhanced water dissociation on these processes can then be studied.'],\n",
       " '40520967': [\"\\xa0Wood from white spruce Picea glauca that had been preserved by rapid burial in lake sediments 10,000 years ago, was investigated and compared to a contemporary reference white spruce wood. The 10,000-year old sample appeared to have an intact primary cell wall and middle lamella, whereas the carbohydrate monomer distribution, and microscopic images showed that the secondary wall was at least partially removed, indicating that this structure had been selectively attacked by bacteria. The Klason lignin amount in the aged spruce was found to be 60%. The relative lignin monomer content in the aged spruce was 9% lower than that of the reference wood, showing that there were fewer beta-O-4' linkages in the aged sample. This finding was supported by SEC analysis of the thioacidolysed samples as a larger proportion of lignin oligomers were observed in the aged spruce than in the reference material. This indicates a somewhat greater number of condensed bonds in the aged spruce than in the reference spruce sample. Quantitative C-13 NMR analysis and HSQC techniques applied on milled wood lignins (MWL) revealed no significant structural differences between the aged spruce and the reference.\"],\n",

In order to get cohomological information we wish to make S-n-equivariant counts of the numbers of points defined over finite fields of this moduli space. We find recurrence relations in the genus that these numbers fulfill. Thus, if we can make S-n-equivariant counts of H-g,H-n for low genus, then we can do this for every genus. Information about curves of genus 0 and 1 is then found to be sufficient to compute the answers for H-g,H-n for all g and for n &lt;= 7. These results are applied to the moduli spaces of stable curves of genus 2 with up to 7 points, and this gives us the S-n-equivariant Galois (resp. Hodge) structure of their l-adic (resp. Betti) cohomology.'],\n",

Coordination applies to real situations, where wind power and hydropower are owned by different utilities, sharing the same transmission lines, though hydropower has priority for transmission capacity. Coordination is thus necessary to minimize wind energy curtailments during congestion situations. The planning algorithm accounts for the uncertainty of wind power forecasts and power market price uncertainty. Planning for the spot market and the regulating market is considered in the algorithm. The planning algorithm is applied to a case study and the results are summarized in the paper.'],\n",

We analyze the proposed design both analytically and experimentally, and we also evaluate its performance in the application of an attractor neural network. The EWMA in the proposed design has a constant relative truncation error, which is important for avoiding round-off errors in applications with slowly decaying processes, e.g. connectionist networks. We conclude that the proposed design offers greatly improved memory and computational efficiency compared to a naive implementation of the EWMA's difference equation, and that it is well suited for implementation in digital hardware.\"],\n",

Facilitated by a real-time monitoring system, the proposed methodologies can be applied to integrate with functions of dynamic scheduling in a distributed environment. A function block-enabled process planning approach is proposed to handle dynamic changes during process plan generation and execution. This paper focuses mainly on distributed process planning, particularly on the development of a function block designer that can encapsulate generic process plans into function blocks for runtime execution. As function blocks can sense environmental changes on a shop floor, it is expected that a so-generated process plan can adapt itself to the shop floor environment with dynamically optimized solutions for plan execution and process monitoring.'],\n",

In addition to performing well in practice, the NJ algorithm has optimal reconstruction radius.</p><p>The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) we present an algorithm called Fast Neighbor Joining(FNJ) with optimal reconstruction radius and optimal run time complexity O(n(2)) and (2) we present a greatly simplified proof for the correctness of NJ. initial experiments show that FNJ in practice has almost the same accuracy as NJ, indicating that the property of optimal reconstruction radius has great importance to their good performance.

       " '478': ['Mammography is currently one of the most common x-\\x90ray imaging examinations. More than 100 million women worldwide are screened every year and early detection of breast cancer through mammography has proven to be a key to significantly reduced mortality. The requirement on spatial resolution as well as contrast resolution is very high in order to detect and diagnose the cancer. Moreover, because of the large number of women going through this procedure and the fact that more than 99 % are healthy, it also becomes very important to minimize the radiation dose. Photon counting may be one way to meet the demands and mammography is the first modality in x-\\x90ray imaging to implement photon counting detectors. FDA approval is still pending but they are currently in routine clinical use in more than 15 countries. The photon counting enables a discrimination of all electronic noise and a more optimum use of the information in each x-\\x90ray. The absence of electronic noise is particularly important in low dose applications, in for example tomosynthesis a number of exposures from different angles are required and since the dose in each projection is just a fraction of the total dose for a mammogram the sensitivity to electronic noise will increase. Using the spectral information for each x-\\x90ray it is in principle possible to deduce the elemental composition of an object in the breast. This could for example be used to enhance microcalcifications relative to soft tissue and differentiate water from fat in cysts. Recently contrast mammography has attracted significant attention. In this application Iodine is used as a contrast media to visualize the vascular structure. As in breast MRI the cancer stand out because of the leaky vessels resulting from its angiogenesis. A photon counting detector gives a unique opportunity to image the Iodine through spectral imaging by adjusting one of the thresholds to its K-\\x90edge. Challenges for photon counting in mammography are high rates of x-\\x90rays, both to generate the required flux at the source and to handle the rates at the detector without pile-\\x90up. Even more difficult to handle are the charge sharing between detector pixels which, if not corrected for, will compromise the energy information. The current status of photon counting detectors in mammography will be described together with strategies to overcome the pit-\\x90falls. Also future possibilities with spectral imaging in mammography will be investigated and examples from ongoing clinical trials will be given. Learning Objectives: 1.

Geochemical studies of shallow alluvial aquifer in the Meghna flood plain show that the uppermost yellowish grey sediment is low in As (1.03 mg/kg) compared to the lower dark grey to black sediment (5.24 mg/kg) rich in mica and organic matter. Sequential extraction data show that solid phase As bound to poorly crystalline and amorphous metal (Fe, Mn, Al)-oxyhydroxides is dominant in the grey to dark grey sediment and reaches its maximum level (3.05 mg/kg) in the mica rich layers. Amount of As bound to sulphides and organic matter also peaks in the dark grey to black sediment. Vertical distributions of major elements determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) show that iron (Fe2O3), aluminum (Al2O3) and manganese (MnO) follow the general trend of distribution of As in the sediments. Concentrations of As, Mn, Fe, HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-) and NO3 (-) in groundwater reflect the redox status of the aquifer and are consistent with solid phase geochemistry. Mineralogical analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fitted with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) revealed dominance of crystalline iron oxides and hydroxides like magnetite, hematite and goethite in the oxidised yellowish grey sediment. Amorphous Fe-oxyhydroxides identified as grain coating in the mica and organic matter rich sediment suggests weathering of biotite is playing a critical role as the source of Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides which in turn act as sink for As.

A boundary layer  of Falkner-“Skan-“Cooke type with favourable pressure gradient is  considered to model the flow slightly downstream of a swept-wing leading  edge. In this region, stationary and travelling crossflow instability  dominates over other instability types. Three scenarios are  investigated: the presence of low-amplitude chordwise localized,  spanwise periodic roughness elements on the plate, the impingement of a  weak vortical free-stream mode on the boundary layer and the combination  of both disturbance sources. Three receptivity mechanisms are  identified: steady receptivity to roughness, unsteady receptivity to  free-stream vorticity and unsteady receptivity to vortical modes  scattered at the roughness. Both roughness and vortical modes provide  efficient direct receptivity mechanisms for stationary and travelling  crossflow instabilities. We find that stationary crossflow modes  dominate for free-stream turbulence below a level of about 0.5%, whereas  higher turbulence levels will promote the unsteady receptivity  mechanism. Under the assumption of small amplitudes of the roughness and  the free-stream disturbance, the unsteady receptivity process due to  scattering of free-stream vorticity at the roughness has been found to  give small initial disturbance amplitudes in comparison to the direct  mechanism for free-stream modes. However, in many environments  free-stream vorticity and roughness may excite interacting unstable  stationary and travelling crossflow waves.

There was also a difference depending on the Molecular mass of the polymers, demonstrating a greater adhesion for the low molecular mass combination of polyelectrolytes. Furthermore, die time in contact showed to be of importance, with increasing pull-off forces with contact time at maximum load. The SFA measurements were conducted under dry conditions, at 100% RH, and under wet conditions for PEMs adsorbed at pH 7.5/3.5. The SFA adhesion measurements showed that under dry conditions, the adhesive forces between two high energetic mica substrates were lowered when they were covered by PEMs before the measurements. The thickness of the adsorbed layers was also measured using SFA. This showed that there was a significant swelling when the dry layers were exposed to 100% RH or to wet conditions.

The water content of the PEMs was approximately 80% at both electrolyte concentrations. However, the thickness of the PEMs formed at 10 mM NaCl was approximately twice the thickness formed at I mM NaCl. The viscoelastic properties of the starch PEMs, modeled as Voigt elements, were dependent on the polyelectrolyte that was adsorbed in the outermost layer. The PEMs appeared to be more rigid when capped by anionic starch than when capped by cationic starch.

Malignancy is however, rare, the yearly incidence being 0.5-2 per million inhabitants, but associated with a very aggressive behaviour. Adrenocortical tumours are often associated with altered hormone production with a variety of clinical symptoms. The aggressiveness of carcinomas together with the high frequency of adenomas calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and an improvement of the diagnostic possibilities. Methods: Microarray gene expression analysis was performed in tumours of adrenocortex with emphasis on malignancy as well as hormonal activity. The sample set consisted of 17 adenomas, 11 carcinomas and 4 histological normal adrenocortexes. RNA from these was hybridised according to a reference design on microarrays harbouring 29 760 human cDNA clones. Confirmation was performed with quantitative real time-PCR and western blot analysis. Results: Unsupervised clustering to reveal relationships between samples based on the entire gene expression profile resulted in two subclusters; carcinomas and non-cancer specimens. A large number of genes were accordingly found to be differentially expressed comparing carcinomas to adenomas. Among these were IGF2, FGFR1 and FGFR4 in growth factor signalling the most predominant and also the USP4, UBE2C and UFD1L in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, two subgroups of carcinomas were identified with different survival outcome, suggesting that survival prediction can be made on the basis of gene expression profiles. Regarding adenomas with aldosterone overproduction, OSBP and VEGFB were among the most up-regulated genes compared with the other samples. Conclusions: Adrenocortical carcinomas are associated with a distinct molecular signature apparent in their gene expression profiles.

The methods are applied to the two-dimensional spatially developing Blasius boundary-layer. A critical step in the process of systematically investigating stability properties and designing feedback controllers is solving very large eigenvalue problems by storing only velocity fields at different times instead of large matrices. For stability analysis, where the entire dynamics of perturbations in space and time is of interest, iterative and adjoint-based optimization techniques are employed to compute the global eigenmodes and the optimal initial conditions. The latter are the initial conditions yielding the largest possible energy growth over a finite time interval. The leading global eigenmodes take the shape of Tollmien-Schlichting wavepackets located far downstream in streamwise direction, whereas the leading optimal disturbances are tilted structures located far upstream in the boundary layer. For control design on the other hand, the input-output behavior of the system is of interest and the snapshot-method is employed to compute balanced modes that correctly capture this behavior. The inputs are external disturbances and wall actuation and the outputs are sensors that extract wall shear stress. A low-dimensional model that capture the input-output behavior is constructed by projection onto balanced modes. The reduced-order model is then used to design a feedback control strategy such that the growth of disturbances are damped as they propagate downstream.'],\n",

However, the overall WGS activity was very low for all catalysts, even with external water addition to the feed, resulting in low FT productivities (per gram catalyst) due to the low partial pressure of H-2. A higher Fe:Co ratio in the bimetallic catalyst generally resulted in higher relative WGS activity, but did not lower the H-2/CO usage ratio to the desired value of 1.0. For the Fe-containing catalysts, the space-time yield of hydrocarbons (HCs) decreased with increasing partial pressure of water or reduced space velocity, indicating an inhibition of water on the FT activity, most often resulting in low FT productivity under the conditions with highest relative WGS activity (usage ratios closest to the inlet H-2/CO ratio). Moreover, the co-impregnation technique resulted in a surface enrichment of Fe, at least for the Co-rich samples, covering the Co sites. For the bimetallic catalysts, both FT and WGS activities rapidly declined at high partial pressure of water due to deactivation by oxidation and sintering. However, the results indicate that WGS and FT proceeded over sites of different nature in the bimetallic catalysts.The bimetallic catalysts showed essentially no synergy effects with respect to HC selectivities and olefin/paraffin ratios, which partly can be explained by the use of a sub-stoichiometric H-2/CO ratio as feed. The higher the Fe content, the lower were the C5+ selectivity and C-3 olefin/paraffin ratio. Water addition increased the C5+ selectivity and C-3 Olefin/paraffin ratio and reduced the CH4 selectivity.'],\n",

It has been demonstrated that the low transverse shear modulus G(RT) in spruce contributes to large transverse strain inhomogeneities due to the annual ring structure in combination with shear coupling effects. In the present study, improved understanding of annual ring effects is achieved by the development of a micromechanical model. It relates the functional density gradient in spruce annual rings to shear modulus GRT. The geometrical basis is a hexagonal cell model, and in shear it is demonstrated to deform primarily by cell wall bending. Full-field strain measurements by digital speckle photography (DSP) show very strong correlation with predicted shear strains at the annual ring scale. Predictions are obtained by implementation of the micromechanics model in a finite element (FE) model developed for the single cube apparatus shear specimen. The low GRT of spruce is due to the strong dependence of GRT on relative density rho/rho(s)(G(RT) proportional to (rho/rho(s))(3)). This is particularly important in spruce.

Based on this distribution, approximate expressions were derived for the transient rolling distance and transient behaviour of the tangential load. The transient period could end in gross sliding or steady-state creep with the Carter traction distribution and stick-slip regions in the contact. The expressions and the transient traction distributions were validated numerically using FEM. Simulations with constant applied slip showed that when rolling started from a tangentially unloaded and unstrained position, the steady-state traction distribution by Carter was a good approximation of the actual transient traction distribution. The solution was accurate for transient rolling lengths longer than a quarter of the contact width. The transient behaviour depended on the bulk geometry of the structures.

Results: Head-to-tail dimerization of the Affibody molecule improved the dissociation rate. In vitro, dimeric forms demonstrated superior cellular retention of radioactivity.

Major advances in hydrodynamics stability, such as global modes in spatially inhomogeneous systems and transient growth of non-normal systems, are reviewed. Input-output analysis generalizes hydrodynamic stability analysis by considering a finite-time horizon over which energy amplification, driven by a specific input (disturbances/actuator) and measured at a specific output (sensor), is observed. In the control design the loop is closed between the output and the input through a feedback gain. Model reduction approximates the system with a low-order model, making modern control design computationally tractable for systems of large dimensions. Methods from control theory are reviewed and applied to the Ginzburg-Landau equation in a manner that is readily generalized to fluid mechanics problems, thus giving a fluid mechanics audience an accessible introduction to the subject.'],\n",

The steady flow, obtained by means of selective frequency damping, consists mainly of a (steady) counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) in the far field and horseshoe-shaped vortices close to the wall. High-frequency unstable global eigenmodes associated with shear-layer instabilities on the CVP and low-frequency modes associated with shedding vortices in the wake of the jet are identified.

The NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) has provided digital elevation models (DEM) for over 80% of the land surface on earth. The latest version 3.0 SRTM data provided by the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research-Consortium for Spatial Information GeoPortal is the result of substantial editing effort on the SRTM digital elevation data produced by NASA. Easy availability of SRTM 3 arc second data has resulted in great advances in morphometric studies and numerical description of terrain surface features as shown by many literature references. The first derivative, slope steepness and second derivatives, minimum curvature, maximum curvature and cross-sectional curvature of elevation were derived by fitting bivariate quadratic surfaces with nine window sizes ranging from 5 to 55 cells to the processed SRTM DEM 90 m Version 3.0. These analyses represent landform entities with ground distances from 450 to 4950 m, which are local to regional features. The four morphometric parameters were used as input for the SOM algorithm. Forty-two SOMs with different learning parameter sets, e.g. initial radius, final radius and number of iterations were investigated. An optimal SOM with 10 classes based on 1000 iteration and a final neighbourhood radius of 0.01 provide a low average quantization error of 0.1780 and was used for further analysis. The effect of the random initial weights for optimal SOM was also studied. The results in this particular study are not sensitive to the randomization of initial weight vectors if many iterations are used. Feature space analysis, morphometric signatures, three-dimensional inspection and auxiliary data facilitated the assignment of semantic meaning to the output classes in terms of morphometric features. Results are provided as thematic maps of landform entities based on form and slopes. The result showed that a SOM is an efficient scalable tool for analysing geomorphometric features as meaningful landforms over different spatial extents, and uses the full potential of morphometric characteristics.

One dynamic model and one non-dynamic model are proposed. The non-dynamic model represents a computationally efficient subgrid scale (SGS) stress model, whereas the dynamic model is the most accurate. The models are validated through large eddy simulations (LESs) of spanwise and streamwise rotating channel flow and are compared with the standard and dynamic Smagorinsky models. The proposed explicit dependence on the system rotation improves the description of the mean velocity profiles and the turbulent kinetic energy at high rotation rates. Comparison with the dynamic Smagorinsky model shows that not using the eddy-viscosity assumption improves the description of both the Reynolds stress anisotropy and the SGS stress anisotropy. LESs of rotating channel flow at Re-tau = 950 have been carried out as well. These reveal some significant Reynolds number influences on the turbulence statistics. LESs of non-rotating turbulent channel flow at Re-tau = 950 show that the new explicit model especially at coarse resolutions significantly better predicts the mean velocity, wall shear and Reynolds stresses than the dynamic Smagorinsky model, which is probably the result of a better prediction of the anisotropy of the subgrid dissipation.'],\n",

To reduce the radar cross section for the cross-polarization an absorbing layer is positioned above the ground plane, which affects some of the guided modes that lead to scan blindnesses. An experimental antenna with 16Á—16 elements was built, and it was found that the H-plane performance for large scan angles for the finite antenna deviates more than expected from the infinite array approximation. Otherwise both mutual coupling measurements and embedded element patterns agrees well with the numerical results.'],\n",

In the FCCS measurements, the  fluorescence signal from the predominant emission wavelength range of  the protonated form of the dye is cross-correlated with that of the  deprotonated form. Two lasers are used alternatingly to excite  predominantly the protonated and the deprotonated form of the dye.

This structure exhibits large signature splitting at low spins that disappears after the paired band crossing because of the alignment of a pair of i(13/2) neutrons. This effect is ascribed to triaxial shape changes induced by the core-polarizing properties of the deformation-aligned h(11/2) proton and the rotation-aligned i(13/2) neutrons. Two additional strongly coupled band structures have been established and are discussed in terms of octupole-vibrational and two-quasiparticle excitations built on the yrast structure.

As a benchmark case, we considered two-dimensional steady flow in a rectangular domain characterized by multi-Gaussian heterogeneity structure with an isotropic exponential correlation and lnK variance sigma(2)(Y) up to 8. Advective transport is investigated using the travel time framework where Lagrangian variables (e. g., velocity, transverse displacement, or travel time) depend on space rather than on time. We find that Eulerian and Lagrangian velocity distributions diverge for increasing lnK variance due to enhanced channeling. Transverse displacement is a nonnormal for all sigma(2)(Y) and control planes close to the injection area, but after xI(Y) = 20 was found to be nearly normal even for high sigma(2)(Y). Travel time distribution deviates from the Fickian model for large lnK variance and exhibits increasing skewness and a power law tail for large lnK variance, the slope of which decreases for increasing distance from the source; no anomalous features are found. Second moment of advective transport is analyzed with respect to the covariance of two Lagrangian velocity variables: slowness and slope which are directly related to the travel time and transverse displacement variance, which are subsequently related to the longitudinal and transverse dispersion. We provide simple estimators for the Eulerian velocity variance, travel time variance, slowness, and longitudinal dispersivity as a practical contribution of this analysis. Both two-parameter models considered (the advection-dispersion equation and the lognormal model) provide relatively poor representations of the initial part of the travel time probability density function in highly heterogeneous porous media. We identify the need for further theoretical and experimental scrutiny of early arrival times, and the need for computing higher-order moments for a more accurate characterization of the travel time probability density function. A brief discussion is presented on the challenges and extensions for which AFMCM is suggested as a suitable approach.'],\n",

It maximizes Shannon entropy, satisfying the moment constraints. Thus, the MaxEnt algorithm transforms the original constrained optimization problem to the unconstrained dual optimization problem using Lagrangian multipliers. The Classic Moment Problem (CMP) uses algebraic power moments, causing typical conventional numerical methods to fail for higher-order moments (m &gt; 5-10) due to different sensitivities of Lagrangian multipliers and unbalanced nonlinearities. Classic MaxEnt algorithms overcome these difficulties by using orthogonal polynomials, which enable roughly the same sensitivity for all Lagrangian multipliers. In this paper, we employ an idea based on different principles, using Fup(n) basis functions with compact support, which can exactly describe algebraic polynomials, but only if the Fup order-n is greater than or equal to the polynomial's order. Our algorithm solves the CMP with respect to the moments of only low order Fup(2) basis functions, finding a Fup(2) optimal pdf with better balanced Lagrangian multipliers. The algorithm is numerically very efficient due to localized properties of Fup(2) basis functions implying a weaker dependence between Lagrangian multipliers and faster convergence. Only consequences are an iterative scheme of the algorithm where power moments are a sum of Fup(2) and residual moments and an inexact entropy upper bound. However, due to small residual moments, the algorithm converges very quickly as demonstrated on two continuous pdf examples - the beta distribution and a bi-modal pdf, and two discontinuous pdf examples - the step and double Dirac pdf. Finally, these pdf examples present that Fup MaxEnt algorithm yields smaller entropy value than classic MaxEnt algorithm, but differences are very small for all practical engineering purposes.\"],\n",

Vectors encoding individual members of a naive 10(9) affibody protein library fused to a C-terminal fragment of the beta-lactamase reporter were distributed via phage infection to a culture of cells harbouring a common construct encoding a fusion protein between a non-membrane anchored version of a human TNF-alpha target and the N-terminal segment of the reporter. An initial binding analysis of 29 library variants derived from surviving colonies using selection plates containing ampicillin and in some cases also the P-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam, indicated a stringent selection for target binding variants. Subsequent analyses showed that the binding affinities (K(D)) for three selected variants studied in more detail were in the range 14-27 nm.

It is 5.2 percentage points higher than the most probable alternative, i.e. using a natural gas fired combined cycle and a pulverised coal fired condensing plant separately with the same fuel split ratio. The largest part of the penalty is associated with the lower mass flow of flue gas after CO<sub>2</sub> capture, which leads to a decrease in work output in the expander and potential for feed water heating. The penalty caused by the regeneration of absorbent is quite low, since the high pressure permits the use of potassium carbonate, which requires less regeneration heat than for example the more commonly proposed monoethanolamine.

Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that glutamate, acting on group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), increases the permeability of astrocyte AQP4, which, in situations of hypoxia-ischemia, will increase astrocyte water uptake. Here we report that erythropoietin (EPO), which in recent years has emerged as a potent neuro-protective agent, antagonizes the effect of a group I mGluR agonist on astrocyte water permeability. Activation of group I mGluRs triggers fast and highly regular intracellular calcium oscillations and we show that EPO interferes with this signaling event by altering the frequency of the oscillations. These effects of EPO are immediate, in contrast to the neuroprotective effects of EPO that are known to depend upon gene activation. Our findings indicate that EPO may directly reduce the risk of astrocyte swelling in stroke and other brain insults.

In this study, two non-overlapping parts of human Cytokeratin-17, a protein belonging to the intermediate filament family of highly sequence-related proteins, were selected as a model system to study the specificity and cross reactivity of antibodies generated towards such a target. These recombinantly produced Protein Epitope Signature Tags (PrESTs) were immunized in five rabbits each and the batch-to-batch variations in the obtained immune responses were studied by mapping of linear epitopes using synthetic overlapping peptides.

The general theory is applied to fullerene C-60 because of its good optical limiting properties, namely, a rather low ground state absorption and a strong triplet-triplet absorption. It is shown that sequential absorption involving strong triplet-triplet transitions is the major mechanism of nonlinear absorption. The intrinsic hierarchy of time scales makes an adiabatic solution of the coupled rate equations valid, which therefore can be reduced to a single dynamical equation for the ground state population. The slow evolution of this population is defined by an effective rate of population transfer to the triplet state and by the pulse duration. The propagation effect plays an important role in the optical power limiting performance. The intensity of the field as well as the population of the triplet state decreases during the pulse propagation, and a weakened nonlinear sequential two-photon absorption is followed by a linear one-photon absorption which gradually becomes the dominating process. The competition between these qualitatively different processes depends on the field intensity, the length of the absorber, and the concentration. The pulse propagation is studied by solving numerically the two-dimensional paraxial field equation together with the effective rate equation for the ground state population.'],\n",

The general theory is applied to fullerence C-60,  which is a popular reverse saturable absorption material and a good  limiter because of its larger excited-state absorption cross-section  compared with that of the ground state. The propagation of the front  subpulses is mainly affected by the linear transition between the ground  state and the first excited singlet state, while the latter subpulses  are attenuated by the excited-state absorption. Moreover, these two  different kinds of absorption mechanisms result in different radial  distributions for different subpulses.

Speckle tracking-based techniques allow for accurate measurement of movement and deformation variables in the arterial wall in both the radial and the longitudinal direction. The aim of this study was to test if speckle tracking-derived deformation data could be used as input for wave intensity calculations. The new concept was to approximate changes of flow and pressure by deformation changes of the arterial wall in longitudinal and radial directions. Flow changes (dU/dt) were approximated by strain rate (sr, 1/s) of the arterial wall in the longitudinal direction, whereas pressure changes (dP/dt) were approximated by sign reversed strain rate (1/s) in the arterial wall in the radial direction. To validate the new concept, a comparison between the newly developed Wave Intensity Wall Analysis (WIWA) algorithm and a commonly used and validated wave intensity system (SSD-5500, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) was performed. The studied population consisted of ten healthy individuals (three women, seven men) and ten patients (all men) with coronary artery disease.

We also illustrate how the dynamical deficiencies of one feedback motif can be mitigated by an additional loop, while maintaining the original steady-state properties.</p><p>Conclusions: Our analysis emphasizes the core of the regulation found in many motifs at the interface between the metabolic network and the environment of the cell. By simplifying the regulation into uptake and the first metabolic step, we provide a basis for elaborate studies of more realistic network structures.

These phages underwent a genetic reconstruction where Cro was replaced by a dimeric form of the Lac repressor. To clarify the theoretical characteristics of these mutants, we built a detailed thermodynamic model. The mutants all have a different genetic wiring than the wild-type. lambda One group lacks regulation of P-RM by the lytic protein. These mutants only exhibit the lysogenic equilibrium, with no transiently active P-R. The other group lacks the negative feedback from CI. In this group, we identify a handful of bi-stable mutants, although the majority only exhibit the lysogenic equilibrium. The experimental identification of functional phages differs from our predictions. From a theoretical perspective, there is no reason why only 4 out of 900 mutants should be functional. The differences between theory and experiment can be explained in two ways. Either, the view of the lambda phage as a bi-stable system needs to be revised, or the mutants have in fact not undergone a modular replacement, as intended by Atsumi and Little, but constitute instead a wider systemic change.'],\n",

Back-scattered power, attenuation coefficient and phase velocity of ultrasonic waves propagating through suspensions of PVA contrast agents were measured at temperature values ranging between 24 degrees C and 37 degrees C in a frequency range from 3 MHz to 13 MHz. Enhancement of the backscattered power higher than 20 dB and displaying a weak dependence on temperature was observed. Attenuation and phase velocity, on the other hand, showed higher sensitivity to temperature variations. A modified version of the Church model, which accounts for the dispersion of the dynamic modulus of the PVA shells, was developed to simultaneously fit the attenuation and phase velocity data at 24 degrees C. The frequency dependence of the storage modulus was found to be that of semiflexible polymeric networks. On the other hand, the frequency dependence of the dynamic loss modulus suggests that additional mechanisms, which may be related to the finite dimensions of the shell and/or to its inhomogeneity, may play a significant role in the dissipation of the acoustic energy.

In the second part of this communication, the acoustic properties of three types of microbubbles stabilized by poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) shells are further investigated. In particular, the dependence of P-thr on system parameters such as the number of cycles, frequency and exposure is examined. The effects of temperature, blood and, wherever data are available, of the dimension of the microbubbles on P-thr are also considered. The large shelf thickness notwithstanding, the results of this investigation show that at room temperature, PVA contrast agents fracture at negative peak pressure values within the recommended safety limit. Furthermore, P-thr decreases with increasing temperature, radius of the microbubbles and number of cycles of the incident wave. Fatigue seems to be a physical mechanism playing a dominant role in the fracture process. The effect of blood on P-thr varies according to condition under which the microbubbles have been synthesized, although stiffening of the shell is observed in most cases.

The methods use electromigration as a means to speed up the transport process, allowing for fast equilibration between rock sample and tracer solution. An electrical potential gradient acts as a driving force for transport in addition to the concentration gradient and forces the cations through the rock sample towards the cathode. The electrical potential gradient induces both electromigration and electroosmotic flow with a resulting solute transport that is large compared to diffusive fluxes. In one of the methods, the solute is driven through the sample and collected at the cutlet side. In the other, simpler method, the rock sample is equilibrated by circulating the solute through the sample. The equilibration of rock samples, up to 5 cm in length, with an aqueous solution has been accomplished within days to months. Experiments using cesium as a sorbing tracer yield results consistent with considerably more time demanding in-diffusion experiments.

For this storage scenario, the host rock is the third and final barrier for radionuclide migration. Sorption reactions in the crystalline rock matrix have strong retardative effects on the transport of radionuclides. To assess the barrier properties of the host rock it is important to have sorption data representative of the undisturbed host rock conditions. Sorption data is in the majority of reported cases determined using crushed rock. Crushing has been shown to increase a rock samples sorption capacity by creating additional surfaces. There are several problems with such an extrapolation. In studies where this problem is addressed, simple models relating the specific surface area to the particle size are used to extrapolate experimental data to a value representative of the host rock conditions. In this article, we report and compare surface area data of five size fractions of crushed granite and of 100 mm long drillcores as determined by the Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET)-method using N-2-gas. Special sample holders that could hold large specimen were developed for the BET measurements. Surface area data on rock samples as large as the drillcore has not previously been published. An analysis of this data show that the extrapolated value for intact rock obtained from measurements on crushed material was larger than the determined specific surface area of the drillcores, in some cases with more than 1000%. Our results show that the use of data from crushed material and current models to extrapolate specific surface areas for host rock conditions can lead to over estimation interpretations of sorption ability. The shortcomings of the extrapolation model are discussed and possible explanations for the deviation from experimental data are proposed.'],\n",

Results from flow tests reveal much higher pressure drop for higher ice concentrations and higher velocities in comparison to the single phase flow. However for ice concentrations of 15% and higher, certain velocity exists at which ice slurry pressure drop is same or even lower than for single phase flow. It seems that higher ice concentration delay flow pattern transition moment (from laminar to turbulent) toward higher velocities.

The polyelectrolyte adsorption was studied by SPAR as a function of salt concentration, and it was found that the adsorption maximum was located at 1 mM NaCl for polyelectrolytes of low charge density and at 10 mM NaCl for polyelectrolytes of high charge density. Electrostatic screening led to complete elimination of the polyelectrolyte adsorption at salt concentrations of 300 mM NaCl. According to the QCM-D analysis, the cellulose films showed a pronounced swelling in water that took several hours to complete. Subsequent adsorption of polyelectrolytes onto the cellulose films led to a release of water from the cellulose, an effect that was substantial for polyelectrolytes of high charge density at low salt concentrations.

As demonstrated for cortical FS interneurons, these gap junctions in the striatum may cause synchronized spiking, which would increase the influence that FS neurons have on spiking by the striatal medium spiny (MS) neurons. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is characterized by changes in synchrony or periodicity, thus gap junctions between FS interneurons may modulate synchrony and thereby influence behavior such as reward learning and motor control. To explore the roles of gap junctions on activity and spike synchronization in a striatal FS population, we built a network model of FS interneurons. Each FS connects to 30-40% of its neighbors, as found experimentally, and each FS interneuron in the network is activated by simulated corticostriatal synaptic inputs. Our simulations show that the proportion of synchronous spikes in FS networks with gap junctions increases with increased conductance of the electrical synapse; however, the synchronization effects are moderate for experimentally estimated conductances. Instead, the main tendency is that the presence of gap junctions reduces the total number of spikes generated in response to synaptic inputs in the network. The reduction in spike firing is due to shunting through the gap junctions; which is minimized or absent when the neurons receive coincident inputs. Together these findings suggest that a population of electrically coupled FS interneurons may function collectively as input detectors that are especially sensitive to synchronized synaptic inputs received from the cortex.'],\n",

The cooling of the charged air results in higher density and thus volumetric efficiency. It is also important for petrol engines that the knock margin increases with reduced charge air temperature. A property that is still not very well investigated is the sound transmission through a CAC. The losses, due to viscous and thermal boundary layers as well as turbulence, in the narrow cooling tubes result in frequency dependent attenuation of the transmitted sound that is significant and dependent on the flow conditions. Normally, the cross-sections of the cooling tubes are neither circular nor rectangular, which is why no analytical solution accounting for a superimposed mean flow exists. The cross-dimensions of the connecting tanks, located on each side of the cooling tubes, are large compared to the diameters of the inlet and outlet ducts. Three-dimensional effects will therefore be important at frequencies significantly lower than the cut-on frequencies of the inlet/outlet ducts. In this study the two-dimensional finite element solution scheme for sound propagation in narrow tubes, including the effect of viscous and thermal boundary layers, originally derived by Astley and Cummings [Wave propagation in catalytic converters: Formulation of the problem and finite element scheme, Journal of Sound and Vibration 188 (5) (1995) 635-657] is used to extract two-ports to represent the cooling tubes. The approximate solutions for sound propagation, accounting for viscothermal and turbulent boundary layers derived by Dokumaci [Sound transmission in narrow pipes with superimposed uniform mean flow and acoustic modelling of automobile catalytic converters, Journal of Sound and Vibration 182 (5) (1995) 799-808] and Howe [The damping of sound by wall turbulent shear layers, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 98 (3) (1995) 1723-1730], are additionally calculated for corresponding circular cross-sections for comparison and discussion. The two-ports are thereafter combined with numerically obtained multi-ports, representing the connecting tanks, in order to obtain the transmission properties for the charged air when passing the complete CAC. An attractive formalism for representation of the multi-ports based on the admittance relationship between the ports is presented. From this the first linear frequency domain model for CACs, which includes a complete treatment of losses in the cooling tubes and 3D effects in the connecting tanks is extracted in the form of a two-port.

Significant correlations, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.445, between protein and RNA levels were also obtained for a third of the specific gene products. However, the correlation coefficients between levels of RNA and protein products of specific genes varied widely, and the mean correlations between the protein and corresponding RNA levels determined using the cDNA- and oligo-based microarrays were 0.25 and 0.20, respectively. Conclusion: Significant correlations were found in one third of the examined RNA species and corresponding proteins.

Influences of different parameters on dc traction system, such as supply-voltage polarity, relative motion between pantograph and overhead contact wire, namely, forward motion along the track (longitudinal), and lateral sliding motion of the pantograph (zigzag) are presented here.

Due to the fractional order representation mainly, the number of parameters of the model remains low, rendering an easy fitting of the values from tests on material samples. The proposed model is implemented in a general-purpose finite element (FE) code. Since commercial FE codes do not contain any suitable constitutive model that represents the full dynamic behavior of rubber compounds (including frequency and amplitude dependent effects), a simple approach is used based on the idea of adding stress contributions from simple constitutive models: a mesh overlay technique, whose basic idea is to create a different FE model for each material definition (fractional derivative viscoelastic and elastoplastic), all with identical meshes but with different material definition, and sharing the same nodes. Fractional-derivative viscoelasticity is implemented through user routines and the algorithm for that purpose is described, while available von Mises' elastoplastic models are adopted to take rate-independent effects into account.

Results showed that under these conditions ventilation-radiators were able to create a more stable thermal climate than the traditional radiator ventilation arrangements. In addition, when using ventilation-radiators the desired thermal climate could be achieved with a radiator surface temperature as Much as 7.8 degrees C lower. It was concluded that in exhaust-ventilated office rooms, ventilation-radiators can provide energy and environmental savings.'],\n",

Plasminogen activator, a serine protease that regulates blood coagulation, is known to be expressed in the saliva of Desmodus rotundus (common vampire bat) and is thought to be a key enzyme for the emergence of blood feeding in vampire bats. To better understand the evolution of this biological function, we studied the plasminogen activator (PA) genes from all vampire bat species in light of their feeding transition to bird and subsequently mammalian blood. We include the rare species Diphylla ecaudata and Diaemus youngi, where plasminogen activator had not previously been studied and demonstrate that PA gene duplication observed in Desmodus is not essential to the vampire phenotype, but relates to the emergence of predominant mammalian blood feeding in this species. Plasminogen activator has evolved through gene duplication, domain loss, and sequence evolution leading to change in fibrin-specificity and susceptibility to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Before undertaking this study, only the four plasminogen activator isoforms from Desmodus were known. The evolution of vampire bat plasminogen activators can now be linked phylogenetically to the transition in feeding behavior among vampire bat species from bird to mammalian blood.'],\n",

The direct effect is usually decomposed into the effects of the Bouguer shell (-V-B) and the terrain. While the computation of V-B is a simple matter, the detailed consideration of the terrain effect is more difficult. This study emphasizes, that, in principle, the geoid height can be determined by the remove restore technique in considering only V-B and the effect of an arbitrarily small area of the terrain along the radius vector at the computation point, and that the determination of VB requires only the density distribution be known along this radius. The method is justified by the approximation theorems of Runge-Krarup and Keldysh-Lavrentieff. The answer to the headline question is therefore no. A closely related question is how to find a candidate method for the analytical continuation of the external potential. The paper studies whether a Taylor series can take on this role. It is concluded that this series will converge, if the direct effects of the Bouguer potential and the mass of the terrain in a near-zone around the computation point (P) are applied prior to downward continuation. The radius of the near-zone is shown not to exceed that of the height of any mountain around P, which, in the worst case (with P located near the top of Mt Everest) yields a radius of convergence within 9 km. In most cases the radius is much smaller. Hence, only a very local part of the terrain potential must be removed to allow the determination of the geoid height by Taylor expansion. Importantly, if the height of P is at least twice that of any point of the near-zone topography (e.g. for airborne and satellite gravity), the Taylor series always converges without any reduction for terrain.\"],\n",

Barley HvXET6 has a similar apparent molecular mass of 33-35 kDa to the previously purified HvXET5 isoenzyme, but the two isoenzymes differ in their isoelectric points, pH optima, kinetic properties and substrate specificities. The HvXET6 isoenzyme catalyses transfer reactions between xyloglucans and soluble cellulosic substrates, using oligo-xyloglucosides as acceptors, but at rates that are significantly different from those observed for HvXET5.

The distributions of fracture aperture and its evolution during shearing were calculated from the initial aperture, based on the laser-scanned sample surface roughness results, and shear dilations measured in the laboratory tests. Three normal loading conditions were adopted in the tests: simple normal stress and mixed normal stress and normal stiffness to reflect more realistic in situ conditions. A special algorithm for treatment of the contact areas as zero-aperture elements was used to produce more accurate flow field simulations, which is important for continued simulations of particle transport but often not properly treated in literature. The simulation results agree well with the measured hydraulic apertures and flow rate data obtained from the laboratory tests, showing that complex histories of fracture aperture and tortuous flow fields with changing normal loading conditions and increasing shear displacements.

It can, however, also be estimated from a kinetic point of view by studying the process of colloidal coagulation, or from a dynamic point of view by considering colloidal transport in nonequilibrium systems where other processes such as diffusion and the influence of gravity come into play. In particular, in a test tube where colloidal expansion takes place, the ccc can be interpreted as the electrolyte concentration below which expansion of colloids would always lead to full access to the entire volume of the test tube and above which a sharp boundary is established between a colloidal gel and pure water. On the basis of this perception and the dynamic force balance model that we developed to describe colloidal expansion in a test tube, accounting for the effects of particle diffusion and gravity in contrast to the DLVO theory, we propose an alternative way to assess the ccc of counterions.

The estimated ccc values agree quite well with those observed experimentally for both Na+ and Ca2+ counterions for montmorillonite dispersions, at pH similar to 6.5. This is in contrast to the DLVO theory, which overpredicts the ccc by about 2 orders of magnitude.

The selected substitutions at positions Leu537 and Glu542 increase the melting temperature by approximately 10 and 14 degrees C, respectively, relative to the wild-type enzyme. Although both wild-type and single mutants showed first-order inactivation kinetics, thermal unfolding and inactivation was more complex for the double mutants, showing two distinct phases, as revealed by microcalorimetry and CD spectroscopy. Structural information on the variants does not provide a definitive answer with respect to the stabilizing effects or the alteration of the unfolding process.

Applying an augmented generalized method of moments-estimator that accounts for selectivity and simultaneity bias on data from 1,249 MNEs, our research has resulted in five distinct conclusions. First, we find that the knowledge spillovers via R&amp;D collaboration typically take place as a network phenomenon rather than a process between the local firm and a single innovation partner. Second, successful collaboration is conditional on the presence of foreign innovation partners in the network. Third, output is found to be an increasing function of R&amp;D-collaboration only among non-export oriented firms. Fourth, foreign MNEs, selling mainly to local and regional markets in Sweden, benefit more from R&amp;D collaboration than do other firms.

In the present study we have generated c-Jun-binding-affinity proteins from a phage-displayed library of so-called 'Affibody (R) ligands', developed by combinatorial engineering of a non-immunoglobulin-based scaffold protein. Homodimeric c-Jun protein was recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli and, prior to selection, the quality of the target protein was investigated by binding analyses, which indicated specific binding to a double-stranded DNA hairpin construct containing a c-Jun response element, but not to a control sequence. Isolated Affibody (R) variants from the phage selection were expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity chromatography and their interaction with c-Jun was analysed. In biosensor analyses, one Affibody (R) ligand, denoted Z(cJun518) was shown to interact with immobilized c-Jun protein with an apparent dissociation constant of 5 mu M. By constructing a head-to-tail homodimeric version of Z(cJun518), its apparent affinity for c-Jun could be increased threefold, suggesting co-operativity effects in the binding to the immobilized c-Jun protein. Further characterization of the Z(cJun518) Affibody (R) molecule demonstrated, in both affinity-capture and Western-blotting experiments, its ability to interact selectively with c-Jun, even when the c-Jun target was present in a complex protein background consisting of a bacterial cell lysate. Z(cJun518) could also be used to stain the c-Jun-overexpressing cell line C8161 visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

Despite recent advances such as drug eluting stents, clinical studies suggest that stent design is linked to vascular injury. Additionally, dilation of the medical devices may trigger pathological responses such as growth and migration of vascular smooth cells, and may be a potent stimulus for neointimal hyperplasia. The purpose of this study is to experimentally investigate the mechanical characteristics of the transient expansion of six commercially available balloon-expandable stent systems, and to develop a robust finite element model based on the obtained experimental results. To reproduce the inflation of stent systems as in clinical practice, a pneumatic-hydraulic experimental setup is built, able to record loads and deformations. Characteristic pressure-diameter diagrams for the balloon-expandable stents and the detached balloons are experimentally obtained. Additionally, typical measures such as the burst opening pressure, the maximum dog-boning and foreshortening, and the elastic recoil are determined. The adopted constitutive models account for elastoplastic deformation of the stent, and for the nonlinear and anisotropic behavior of the balloon. The employed contact algorithm, based on a C (2)-continuous surface parametrization, efficiently simulates the interaction of the balloon and stent. The computational model is able to successfully capture the experimentally observed deformation mechanisms. Overall, the numerical results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data.'],\n",

First, the solvent dependence of the equilibria between anti-syn forms, C((3'))-endo-C((2'))-endo conformations, and carbinol group rotamers has been discussed from MD calculations. We find that in both the solvents the adenosine molecule can remain either in anti or syn conformations. But, the anti-syn interconversion occurs relatively faster in water solvent than in chloroform solvent. Because of the relatively larger time scale for the interconversion, anti and syn conformational states of adenosine are studied separately in water and chloroform solvents using CPMD calculations. The dipole moments calculated from CPMD and MD calculations for adenosine in water are significantly larger than in chloroform solvent. On the basis of the CPMD calculations, the syn form of adenosine in water has a larger dipole moment than the anti form. Moreover, the molecular geometry of anti and syn forms of adenosine in these two solvents is reported. We report a remarkable solvent effect on the geometry of the anti form of the adenosine, which is attributed to differences in the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen-bonding, stabilization. We also report the solvent effect on the frontier Kohn-Sham orbitals and energy gaps for anti-syn conformational states. Finally, we report the solvation shell structure of adenosine in both the solvents, and we find that the solvent-solute interaction is site-specific in the case of water while in chloroform solvent the interaction is globular isotropic in nature.\"],\n",

A quasi-static electric field structure with a downward parallel electric field forms at altitudes between 800 km and 5000 km, accelerating ionospheric electrons upward, away from the auroral ionosphere. A wealth of related phenomena, including energetic ion conics, electron solitary waves, low-frequency wave activity, and plasma density cavities occur in this region, which also acts as a source region for VLF saucers. Results are presented from sounding rockets and satellites, such as Freja, FAST, Viking, and Cluster, to illustrate the characteristics of the electric fields and related parameters, at altitudes below, within, and above the acceleration region. Special emphasis will be on the high-altitude characteristics and dynamics of quasi-static electric field structures observed by Cluster. These structures, which extend up to altitudes of at least 4-5 Earth radii, appear commonly as monopolar or bipolar electric fields. The former are found to occur at sharp boundaries, such as the polar cap boundary whereas the bipolar fields occur at soft plasma boundaries within the plasma sheet. The temporal evolution of quasi-static electric field structures, as captured by the pearls-on-a-string configuration of the Cluster spacecraft indicates that the formation of the electric field structures and of ionospheric plasma density cavities are closely coupled processes. A related feature of the downward current often seen is a broadening of the current sheet with time, possibly related to the depletion process. Preliminary studies of the coupling of electric fields in the downward current region, show that small-scale structures appear to be decoupled from the ionosphere, similar to what has been found for the upward current region. However, exceptions are also found where small-scale electric fields couple perfectly between the ionosphere and Cluster altitudes. Recent FAST results indicate that the degree of coupling differs between sheet-like and curved structures, and that it is typically partial. The mapping depends on the current-voltage relationship in the downward current region, which is highly non-linear and still unclear, as to its specific form.'],\n",

To guarantee the most realistic conditions-as close to nature as possible-in situ experiments were performed in the Chemlab 2 borehole probe. These migration experiments were complemented by laboratory sorption and migration studies. The latter included batch experiments with flat chips of natural material extracted from fracture surfaces to identify the mineral phases relevant to radionuclide sorption by means of autoradiography. Scanning electron microscopy analyses provided information on the composition of sorption-relevant phases and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Np, Tc, and Fe distribution revealed the redox states of these elements. Important mineral phases retaining all actinides and Tc were Fe-bearing phases.

In order to make the inversion method usable in a realistic application, these features should be possible to obtain from a monocular frontal face video, where the speaker is not required to wear any special markers. In this study, we investigate the importance of visual cues for inversion. Experiments with motion capture data of the face show that important articulatory information can be extracted using only a few face measures that mimic the information that could be gained from a video-based method. We also show that the depth cue for these measures is not critical, which means that the relevant information can be extracted from a frontal video. A real video-based face feature extraction method is further presented, leading to similar improvements in inversion quality. Rather than tracking points on the face, it represents the appearance of the mouth area using independent component images. These findings are important for applications that need a simple audiovisual-to-articulatory inversion technique, e.g. articulatory phonetics training for second language learners or hearing-impaired persons.\"],\n",

Annealing in oxygen gives a stoichiometric (1 x 1) oxygen terminated surface and further annealing in ultra-high vacuum results in a clear (root 3 x root 3)R30 degrees reconstruction and surface faceting. Tunneling from filled states in the reconstructed surface reveals a hexagonal pattern of large protrusions, which show an internal structure. The reconstruction is believed to be due to one-third of a monolayer of ordered oxygen vacancies. At areas on the surface where the large features are missing, another smaller type of protrusions is visible, which is associated with the ideal (1 x 1) surface. The relative position of the two types of features gives two possible models of the (111) surface. In the first model, the (1 x 1) surface is the ideal bulk terminated surface and coordinatively unsaturated oxygen ions are missing in the reconstructed surface. The second model agrees with the first model with the exception that coordinatively unsaturated copper ions in the outmost copper layer are missing in both the (1 x 1) and the reconstructed surface.

It is shown that such profiles are similar to the conventional x-ray-absorption spectrum for a broad class of molecules whose potential energy surfaces of the final and core-excited states are almost parallel. However, substantial differences with the conventional x-ray-absorption profiles are observed in the general case of nonparallel surfaces due to the lifetime vibrational interference.

A model for saccular cerebral aneurysm growth by collagen fibre remodelling. J. Theor. Biol. 247, 775-787]. The continuous turnover of collagen is taken to be the driving mechanism in aneurysmal growth. The collagen production rate depends on the magnitude of the cyclic deformation of fibroblasts, caused by the pulsating blood pressure during the cardiac cycle. The volume density of fibroblasts in the aneurysmal tissue is taken to be constant throughout the growth process. The growth model is assessed by considering the inflation of an axisymmetric membranous piece of aneurysmal tissue, with material characteristics representative of a cerebral aneurysm. The diastolic and systolic states of the aneurysm are computed, together with its load-free state. It turns out that the value of collagen pre-stretch, that determines growth speed and stability of the aneurysm, is of pivotal importance. The model is able to predict aneurysms with typical berry-like shapes observed clinically, and the predicted wall stresses correlate well with the experimentally obtained ultimate stresses of this type of tissue. The model predicts that aneurysms should fail when reaching a size of about 1.2-3.6 mm, which is smaller than what has been clinically observed. With some refinements, the model may, however, be used to predict future growth of diagnosed aneurysms.'],\n",

Receptor-binding studies together with viral production and gene transfer assays showed that the recombinant fiber with ZT in the first position and ZH in the second position (ZTZH) bound to both its targets, whereas surprisingly, the fiber with ZHZT was devoid of binding to HER2/neu.

Recent developments of experimental micro-characterisation techniques have delivered further insight into the appearance and the behaviour of wood at smaller length scales. The improved knowledge and the availability of increasingly powerful micromechanical modelling techniques and homogenisation methods have stimulated rather comprehensive research on multiscale modelling of wood. Linking microstructural properties to macroscopic characteristics is expected to improve the knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of wood and to serve as the basis for the development of innovative wood-based products and for biomimetic material design. Moreover, understanding fundamental aspects of wood machining requires multiscale approaches which can take into account the heterogeneity, anisotropy and hierarchies of wood and wood composites.

Much focus is placed on composite micromechanical models for the wood cell wall and on multiscale models for wood resting upon hierarchical finite element models and on the application of continuum micromechanics, respectively.

The focus of the present study is to investigate such changes between proteins and solvents, using as an illustrating example the structure and dynamics of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) within haloalkane dehalogenase (HAD) as protein and within water as solvent. We have studied DCE within HAD using Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics calculations in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics set-up. We find that the C-Cl bond length is shorter in HAD when compared to solution phase value, whereas the net atomic charges and dipole moment are significantly larger than the solution phase values. In contradiction to the usual trend that molecules in the vicinity of the proteins are less polar, we report the observation that the protein environment indeed polarizes the DCE solute more than the water solvent. Furthermore, within the protein environment we do not observe any conformational transition between gauche and trans conformers, and the DCE remains in the more polar gauche conformer during the entire simulation time scale. However, the trans conformer interconverts to the gauche conformer spontaneously within 0.4 ps, which clearly indicates that the trans conformer is unstable within the HAD protein. In contrast, the scatter diagram of total Kohn-Sham energy and dihedral angle between Cl-C-C-Cl atoms shows that the gauche and trans conformers have comparable energies in water. Overall, the present calculations show the within the protein not only the structure of DCE is altered but also that the conformational interconversion dynamics is affected very much.

Several discrepancies are identified: between national waste policy and the local decision premises, between local waste planning and project decision making, between knowledge gathering and project decision making, and between the legal mechanism in the development consent process and the national environmental quality objectives framework. Our study indicates that the governance frameworks at different levels are quite different, and at least partly incompatible, which causes important coordination problems across levels. Sectoral developments towards an industrial marketisation of waste have rendered frameworks such as local waste plans obsolete.

This article presents a test protocol for description of the mechanical, physical, and chemical property changes during recycling and service life by combining several reprocessing cycles and thermo-oxidation. The test protocol was designed to mimic the degradation mechanisms potentially occurring in the materials during the service life and the reprocessing. Virgin PP and HDPE were multiply processed by injection molding. Service life of plastic materials was modeled by accelerated thermal degradation of one time processed materials. Tensile testing, MFR, HT-SEC, DSC, FTIR, and SEM were used to analyze material changes. In parallel, a set of industrially recycled PP and HDPE were also subjected to the same analyses. The results proved that recycled plastics maintain the majority of the material properties even when reprocessed several times.

By considering both self-clocking and the link integrator effect, the model generalizes existing models and is shown to be more accurate by both open loop and closed loop packet level simulations. It reduces to the known static link model when flows' round trip delays are identical, and approximates the standard integrator link model when there is significant cross traffic. We apply this model to the stability analysis of fast active queue management scalable TCP (FAST TCP) Including its filter dynamics. Under this model, the FAST control law is linearly stable for a single bottleneck link with an arbitrary distribution of round trip delays. This result resolves the notable discrepancy between empirical observations and previous theoretical predictions. The analysis highlights the critical role of self-clocking in TCP stability, and the proof technique is new and less conservative than existing ones.\"],\n",

In base of the experimental results, the influence of oxygen concentration and oxidizer temperature on total mass conversion, the release of fuel nitrogen and the fraction of fuel nitrogen that is oxidized to NOx, is discussed. For oxygen concentration 5-21%, the rate of the thermochemical conversion was shown to be almost independent oxygen concentration when oxidant temperatures of 1073-1273 K were used. The opposite was true for an oxidant temperature of 873 K. Thus there appears to be an oxidant temperature above which devolatilisation is controlled by convective heat transfer rather than reaction. Further it was shown that the release of fuel nitrogen was promoted by an increased oxygen concentration (from 5% to 21% at 1273 K) and an increase of oxidant temperature (from 1073 K to 1273 K at 21% oxygen). An estimate of the devolatilisation of nitrogen from the measured pellet temperature indicated that the devolatilisation of nitrogen is significantly delayed with respect to other components. In fact, during the very initial part of the thermochemical conversion, most released nitrogen appeared to follow the route via char rather than via devolatilisation. Favorable conditions for No reduction thanks to a prompt devolatilisation contemporarily to a release of fuel nitrogen via the char route was believed to be one of the explanation for the evidenced low ratios between NOx emissions and fuel nitrogen released, particularly in the beginning of the experiment. The fact that the amount of released fuel nitrogen that is oxidized to NOx was shown to decrease with increasing oxidant temperatures from 1073 K to 1273 K supports this interpretation, though a higher temperature of the oxidant creates higher devolatilisation rates.\"],\n",

Moreover, the dual cure approach can result in acceptable adhesion of UV primers on SMC substrates if the coating procedure and composition are well designed.

This is a result of enhanced wetting and interaction of the solvent with the SMC Substrate, confirmed by contact angle and gravimetric swelling studies. Furthermore, sanded SMC surfaces demonstrated superior UV primer adhesion. This results from the increased surface area of the topography, confirmed by CSLM and the exposure of more oxygen moieties such as pigments and silanols at the air-substrate interface as confirmed by AFM and XPS, The UV films have a higher modulus with increasing resin functionality and resulting cross-link density which correlated with reduced adhesion in formulations without an added isocyanate functional UV monomer.

The fuel blends that had higher fuel sensitivity were more resistant to autoignition for low intake temperature and high intake pressure and less resistant to autoignition for high intake temperature and low intake pressure. A sensitivity analysis shows that at high intake temperature the chemistry of the fuels ethanol, toluene and diisobutylene helps to advance ignition. This is consistent with the trend that fuels with the least Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) behavior show the highest octane sensitivity, and become less resistant to autoignition at high intake temperatures. For high intake pressure the sensitivity analysis shows that fuels in the fuel blend with no NTC behavior consume OH radicals and acts as a radical scavenger for the fuels with NTC behavior. This is consistent with the observed trend of an increase in RON and fuel sensitivity. With data from shock tube experiments in the literature and HCCI modeling in this work, a correlation between the reciprocal pressure exponent oil the ignition delay to the fuel sensitivity and volume percentage of single-stage ignition fuel in the fuel blend was found. Higher fuel sensitivity and single-stage fuel content generally gives a lower value of the pressure exponent.

In large scale Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham calculations it is important to be able to enforce matrix sparsity while keeping errors under control. Truncation based on some unitary-invariant norm allows for control of errors in the occupied subspace as described in (Rubensson et al. J Math Phys 49, 032103). The Euclidean norm is unitary-invariant and does not grow intrinsically with system size and is thus suitable for error control in large scale calculations. The presented truncation schemes repetitively use the Lanczos method to compute the Euclidean norms of the error matrix candidates. Ritz value convergence patterns are utilized to reduce the total number of Lanczos iterations.'],\n",

On the basis of data measured by the FAST spacecraft, conjugate with ground optical observations, we present first a wide and stable winter evening arc, where this standard model does not apply. The arc is observed in the Harang region during the growth phase of a modest substorm, poleward of the convection reversal (CR) boundary. Although the magnetic field data suggest the typical configuration, the two FAC sheets appear to be decoupled near the satellite footprint: the upward FAC is fed by the westward electrojet (WEJ), while the downward FAC feeds the eastward electrojet (EEJ). The examination of the arc by the newly developed ALADYN technique confirms this peculiar current topology. For comparison, we apply ALADYN also to a second evening arc, located within the Harang region equatorward from the CR. The arc is confirmed to have the standard configuration, consistent with a former study, but substantial FAC-EJ coupling is inferred in the auroral oval both poleward and equatorward of the arc. A key element for the topology of the current closure is the westward component of the electric field, which influences the relative location of the CR with respect to the large-scale FAC reversal (FR) boundary. As proved by tests on synthetic data, a westward component of the electric field pushes the CR toward the FR, preventing thus the standard FAC closure, while the conductance and FAC pattern shape the CR profile. Since a westward electric field is often measured in the Harang region, the FAC-EJ coupling is expected to be an essential ingredient there. This has important implications for the current closure in the equatorial magnetosphere and for the auroral current circuit in the WEJ region, closely related to the substorm process.'],\n",

Some degradation in normalized H-mode confinement, as given by the H98(gamma,2)-factor, could be observed at high gas injection rates in these scenarios, but this was rather due to total gas injection and not specifically to the local gas puffing used for LH coupling. Furthermore, experiments carried out in L-mode plasmas in order to evaluate the effect on the LH current drive efficiency, when using local gas injection to improve the coupling, indicate only a small degradation (Delta I-LH/I-LH similar to 15%).

It is the first time that rotation profiles in JET plasmas with LH waves have been measured in dedicated discharges. It is found that the toroidal plasma rotation in the outer region of the plasmas is in the co-current direction irrespective of the heating scenario. An interesting feature is that the toroidal rotation profile appears to be hollow in many discharges at low plasma current, but a low current in itself does not seem to be a sufficient condition for finding such profiles. Fast ion transport and finite orbit width effects are mechanisms that could explain hollow rotation profiles. This possibility has been investigated by numerical simulations of the torque on the bulk plasma due to fast ICRF accelerated ions.

Here I propose a special perturbative approach to treat self-consistently all the degrees of freedom in the problem. I show that there exists a length scale for a Hopfion texture where the electrodynamics of a two-component superconductor is dominated by a self-induced Faddeev term, which is in stark contrast to the Meissner electrodynamics of single-component systems. I also show that at certain short length scales knotted solitons in the two-component Ginzburg-Landau model are not described by a Faddeev-Skyrme-type model and are unstable. However, these solitons can be stable at some intermediate length scales. I argue that configurations with high topological charge may be more stable in these systems than low-charge configurations. In the second part of the paper I discuss qualitatively different physics of the stability of knotted solitons in a more general Ginzburg-Landau model and point out the physically relevant terms which enhance or suppress the stability of knotted solitons.

The three weakest substorms leave no clear signatures in the auxiliary parameters. For the other events, the AE increase appears with a time delay of 5-15 min after onset.

       " '40762305': ['This paper investigates the possibilities for structural optimisation of laser-welded sandwich panels with an adhesively bonded core and uni-directional vertical webs. Closed form expressions for the equivalent stiffness and elastic buckling strength of laser-welded sandwich panels are discussed and numerically evaluated to demonstrate the effect of parameter variations on stress and deflection. Due to the number of design variables and constraints a structural optimisation method based on the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) is implemented and used to minimise the structural weight per square meter of panel for a typical accommodation deck configuration. It is concluded that, within the span of production parameters and rule requirements, substantial improvements can be made with or without an adhesively bonded core. Without core material and without any changes to the surrounding structure the structural weight for standard production panels can be reduced considerably, by reducing the face plate thickness and by using thinner and fewer webs. Additional weight can be saved by removing all but a few webs and injecting low-cost polyurethane foam into the cavities, giving added thermal-acoustic insulation, or by incorporating a more structural core with greater thickness and higher density, by which the free span of the sandwich panel can be increased.'],\n",

Objective: To investigate reactivities of anti-CCP to various citrullinated proteins/peptides, which represent potential autoantigens in RA, and to examine the relationship between such antibodies, and their association with genetic variants within HLA-DRB1 SE alleles. Methods: Serum samples from 291 patients with established RA and 100 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects were included in this study. Sera were first analysed for presence of anti-CCP antibodies and further for IgG and IgA antibodies towards candidate autoantigens in both their native and citrullinated form including: fibrinogen, alpha-enolase peptide-1 and the C1-epitope of type II collagen (C1(III)). Antibody specificity was confirmed by cross-reactivity tests. HLA-DR genotyping was performed. Results: 72% of patients with RA were anti-CCP positive. Among the candidate autoantigens examined, IgG antibodies to citrullinated fibrinogen were found in 66% of patients' sera and in 41% for both citrullinated alpha-enolase peptide-1 and citrullinated C1(III). These antibodies were mainly seen in the anti-CCP-positive patient group; they were specific for their respective antigen and displayed limited cross reactivity. IgA responses were also detected, but less frequently than IgG. Anti-CCP and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies were associated with HLA-DRB1*04 rather than with HLA-DRB1*01 alleles. Conclusions: Antibodies directed against several citrullinated antigens are present in CCP-positive RA, with many patients displaying multireactivity. All specific reactivities were primarily associated with the HLA-DRB1*04 alleles, suggesting common pathways of anti-citrulline immunity.\"],\n",

There are just a few general constructions of full rank perfect codes, that are not given by recursive methods using perfect codes of length shorter than n. In this study we construct full rank perfect codes, the so-called normal alpha-codes, by first finding the superdual of the perfect code. The superdual of a perfect code consists of two matrices G and T in which simplex codes play an important role as subspaces of the row spaces of the matrices G and T. The main idea in our construction is the use of alpha-words. These words have the property that they can be added to certain rows of generator matrices of simplex codes such that the result will be (other) sets of generator matrices for simplex codes. The kernel of these normal alpha-codes will also be considered. It will be proved that any subspace, of the kernel of a normal alpha-code, that satisfies a certain property will be the kernel of another perfect code, of the same length n. In this way, we will be able to relate some of the full rank perfect codes of length n to other full rank perfect codes of the same length n.'],\n",

Food items differ substantially when GHG emissions are calculated from farm to table. A recent study of approximate to 20 items sold in Sweden showed a span of 0.4 to 30 kg CO2 equivalents/kg edible product. For protein-rich food, such as legumes, meat, fish, cheese, and eggs, the difference is a factor of 30 with the lowest emissions per kilogram for legumes, poultry, and eggs and the highest for beef, cheese, and pork. Large emissions for ruminants are explained mainly by methane emissions from enteric fermentation. For vegetables and fruits, emissions usually are &lt;= 2.5 kg CO2 equivalents/kg product, even if there is a high degree of processing and substantial transportation. Products transported by plane are an exception because emissions may be as large as for certain meats. Emissions from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as potatoes, pasta, and wheat, are &lt;1.1 kg/kg edible food.

In addition, an analytical expression was derived for the prediction of the drain sink formation height. The calculations using this equation were found to align well with both the experimental data as well as the numerical predictions. This analytical equation is suitable to use for determination of the drain sink formation height as function of the liquid/gas interfacial energy, liquid density, outlet radius and outlet length. In order to demonstrate its industrial usefulness the equation was used to predict drain sink formation heights for steel in a system with geometrical dimensions relevant for steel production. It was found that an increased interfacial energy lowered the drain sink formation height severely for small outlets, low-density fluids and short outlet lengths.

For upward currents, the coupling can be expressed analytically, using the linear current-voltage relation, as outlined by Weimer et al. (1985). This gives a scale size dependent coupling where structures are coupled (decoupled) above (below) a critical scale size. For downward currents, the current-voltage relation is highly non-linear which complicates the understanding of how the coupling works. Results from this experimental study indicate that small-scale structures are decoupled, similar to small-scale structures in the upward current region.

The activity coefficient of vanadium(III) oxide decreased sharply with slag basicity approximately up to a basicity of 1, beyond which it showed a near-constant value.

Experimental results for the resolution of racemic pentan-2-ol, hexan-3-ol, butan-2-ol and octan-4-ol by immobilized CALB-catalyzed acylation with methyl propanoate were obtained by using a solid/gas reactor. Water and substrate adsorption mechanism on immobilized CALB were then studied using moisture sorption analyzer and inverse gas chromatography, and the effective hydration state of the biocatalyst when varying aw was defined. The data showed a pronounced aw effect on both activity and enantioselectivity. If secondary alcohol follows the steric rules for being efficiently resolved, water at very low aw increased enantioselectivity by acting predominantly as an enantioselective inhibitor, making the stereospecificity pocket smaller. When increasing aw, water decreased enantioselectivity, due to an unfavourable increase of the entropic term T Delta(R-S)Delta S-double dagger of the differential free energy of activation. The \"turning point\" at which water changed from one predominant role to another would correspond to aw allowing full coverage of polar groups of the immobilized biocatalyst by water molecules.'],\n",

A high-resolution, three-dimensional structure of a nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) endo-xyloglucanase loop mutant, TmNXG1-Delta YNIIG, with an ohgosaccharide product bound in the negative active-site subsites, has been solved by X-ray crystallography. Comparison of this novel complex to that of the strict xyloglucan endotransglycosylase PttXET16-34 from hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x tremuloides), previously solved with a xylogluco-oligosaccharide bound in the positive subsites, highlighted key protein structures that affect the disparate catalytic activities displayed by these closely related enzymes. Combination of these \"partial\" active-site complexes through molecular dynamics simulations in water allowed modeling of wild-type TmNXG1, TmNXG1-Delta YNIIG, and wild-type PttXET16-34 in complex with a xyloglucan octadecasaccharide spanning the entire catalytic cleft. A comprehensive analysis of these full-length complexes underscored the importance of various loops lining the active site.

The LAT was built by an international collaboration with contributions from space agencies, high-energy particle physics institutes, and universities in France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This paper describes the LAT, its preflight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4 x 4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 (x, y) tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an eight-layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths, giving both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern. The calorimeter's depth and segmentation enable the high-energy reach of the LAT and contribute significantly to background rejection. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4, allowing a large FoV (2.4 sr) and ensuring that most pair-conversion showers initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement. Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (1) permit rapid notification of high-energy gamma-ray bursts and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (2) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (3) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (4) localize point sources to 0.3-2 arcmin, (5) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (6) measure the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray background up to TeV energies, and (7) explore the discovery space for dark matter.\"],\n",

As for animal cells, a large range of cellular functions, such as signal transduction, endocytosis and protein trafficking, have been attributed to plant lipid rafts and DRMs. The data available are essentially based on protcomics and more approaches need to be undertaken to elucidate the precise function of individual populations of DRMs in plants. We report here the first isolation of DRMs from purified plasma membranes of a tree species, the hybrid aspen Populus tremula x tremuloides, and their biochemical characterization. Plasma membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100 and the resulting DRMs were isolated by flotation in sucrose density gradients. The DRMs were enriched in sterols, sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and thus exhibited similar properties to DRMs from other species. However, they contained key carbohydrate synthases involved in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis, namely callose [(1 -&gt; 3)-beta-D-glucan] and cellulose synthases. The association of these enzymes with DRMs was demonstrated using specific glucan synthase assays and antibodies, as well as biochemical and chemical approaches for the characterization of the polysaccharides synthesized in vitro by the isolated DRMs. More than 70% of the total glucan synthase activities present in the original plasma membranes was associated with the DRM fraction. In addition to shedding light on the lipid environment of callose and cellulose synthases, our results demonstrate the involvement of DRMs in the biosynthesis of important cell wall polysaccharides.

The adaptive perspective is closely connected to the concept of resilience understood as different views on nature's capacity to absorb shocks, renewal and re-organization. In constructing normative scenarios images of the future are generated illustrating potential ways of living, travelling and consuming products and services where certain goals such as a reduced climate impact are fulfilled. This paper argues that tension arising from climate strategies relying on either adaptation or mitigation strategies, or combining the two strategies, warrant further examination. In this paper the inter-relationships between adaptation and mitigation are discussed by examining processes of citizen-participation in constructing scenarios and applying the concepts of resilience, vulnerability and adaptive capacity. We discuss this using the concept of deliberative planning processes as a means to achieve legitimate, effective and sustainable futures. As a part of this approach, we argue that methods for citizen-participation applied in exploring different science and technology options also provide useful insight for this type of planning processes. The theoretical arguments are combined with examples from environmental scenario construction in practice. The paper brings attention to tensions between sustainability content values, such as reduced climate impact, and more process-oriented values such as legitimacy, learning and participatory scenario construction. Moreover, the concept of open innovation processes is introduced to the context of participatory scenario construction comparing shared ground in terms of user-involvement in search of novel solutions and also increasing robustness of action plans implemented to reduce climate change.\"],\n",

A set of diagnostics for both confined and lost fast ions was employed for investigating the response of fast ions to MHD modes and for studying their behaviour in plasmas with toroidal field ripple and in shear-reversed plasmas. A dependence of the losses on MHD mode amplitude was deduced from the experimental data. A study of various plasma scenarios has shown that a significant redistribution of the fast ions happens during changes in the profile of the safety factor from shear-reversed to monotonic. Significant changes in the losses of ICRH accelerated protons were found to be associated with L-H confinement transitions in plasmas. After an L-H transition, an abrupt decrease in the ICRH proton losses was observed. In plasmas with an internal transport barrier, the loss of ICRH accelerated ions was found to increase as the barrier forms. Further results concerning fast ion losses were obtained during JET experiments in which the magnitude of the TF ripple was varied. The ripple losses of fusion products appear similar to classical losses, and are in agreement with modelling.'],\n",

The concentrations of DOC and HCO3- were highest at Sirajdikhan site, while at the Sonargaon and Chandina sites the concentrations were lower. On the contrary, the NH4+ concentration was high at the Chandina site as compared to the other sites. There was a good match between dissolved As and Fe at the Sirajdikhan and Sonargaon sites, but not at the Chandina site. The dissolved aqueous concentration of Mn was low at the Chandina site, which suggested that the Mn(IV) redox buffering step was missing. Speciation modeling indicated a possibility of siderite precipitation at all sites, but precipitation of rhodochrosite only at the Sonargaon and Sirajdikhan sites.

Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated an impact of sea water and redox status of different samples. These results suggest that the dissolved As is de-coupled from dissolved Mn because when released, As is re-adsorbed onto the Fe(Ill) minerals in solid phase, as well as from dissolved Fe when precipitation of Fe(II) minerals controls the aqueous concentrations of Fe.

The investigation is performed on the TALL test facility at KTH.

Analysis of the experimental results obtained provides a basic understanding and quantification of the regimes of lead-bismuth flow and heat transfer through a straight tube and a U-shaped tube.

In this technical note we study this optimization problem in detail and describe how the minimizer depends on weight selection and on interpolation conditions. We first show that, if, for a sequence of interpolants, the values of the entropy gain of the interpolants converge to the optimum, then the interpolants converge in H-2, but not in H-infinity This result is then used to describe the asymptotic behavior of the interpolant as an interpolation point approaches the boundary of the domain of analyticity. For loop shaping to specifications in control design, it might at first seem natural to place strategically additional interpolation points close to the boundary. However, our results indicate that such a strategy will have little effect on the shape. Another consequence of our results relates to model reduction based on minimum-entropy principles, where one should avoid placing interpolation points too close to the boundary.'],\n",

A mechanism is suggested for the heterogeneous polymerization of styrene mediated by iron (II)-chloride in p-xylene at 50 °C. Varying the mediator amount more than 10-fold revealed that the rate limiting step at low mediator amounts was the adsorption of the initiator or dormant polymer to the mediator surface, whereas at higher mediator amounts, the rate limiting step was instead the activation step in the ATRP equilibrium. The mechanism changed to free radical polymerization in solution at a certain conversion, resulting in lower apparent rate constant and an increased amount of transfer and termination reactions.

The results of such testing are important, in particular, for the characterization of the material properties and the development of constitutive laws that can be used for predictive purposes. However, the literature on this topic in the context of soft tissue biomechanics, in particular, includes some papers that are misleading since they contain errors and false statements. Claims that planar biaxial testing can fully characterize the three-dimensional anisotropic elastic properties of soft tissues are incorrect. There is therefore a need to clarify the extent to which biaxial testing can be used for determining the elastic properties of these materials. In this paper this is explained on the basis of the equations of finite deformation transversely isotropic elasticity, and general planar anisotropic elasticity. It is shown that it is theoretically impossible to fully characterize the properties of anisotropic elastic materials using such tests unless some assumption is made that enables a suitable subclass of models to be preselected.

Measurements in two independent trials were compared with the gold standard-size assessed at The Department Of Production Engineering, The Royal Institute of Technology. Results: In tandem trials, 99.4% (167/168) of the measurements underscored the gold standard size. In the 1st trial, the size in all 84 measurements was underestimated by -40% (range -34% to -45%) and in the 2nd trial the size in 83 of the 84 measurements was underestimated by -34% (range -24% to -42%). Neither the age of the participant, nor the years of experience with clinical endoscopy improved the results obtained. The participants significantly underestimated larger devices (>= 20 mm) whereas the smallest \"polyps\" were also underestimated, but with a lower degree of inaccuracy. The absolute difference between the golden standard size and the mean of all measurements performed on each polyp in 167 out of 168 measurements followed a regular downward trend. The volume of the devices was one of the confounding factors in size assessment. When compared to the gold standard size, the larger the \"polyp\" size, the higher the degree of underestimation.

Apparent micelle molar masses obtained with SLS were analyzed with a model taking into account both micelle growth and interference effects. The analysis shows that pure C(12)G(2) forms small globular micelles whereas C12E6 and the mixtures form elongated micelles of much higher molar mass. The elongated micelles grow with increased concentration according to mean-field theory, and the masses are larger for increasing amounts of C12E6. To describe the SANS and SAXS data for C12E6 and the mixtures, it: was necessary to employ a model with coexisting spherical and spherocylindrical micelles. The SANS and SAXS data were fitted simultaneously using this model with core-shell particles and molecular constraints. All mixtures, as well as pure C12E6, can be described by this model, demonstrating the coexistence of spherical and cylindrical micelles. The spherical micelles are the same size in all samples, whereas the cylindrical micelles grow in length with the fraction of C12E6 in the samples, as well as with concentration, in agreement with the SLS analysis. The mass fraction of surfactant in cylindrical aggregates also increases with the fraction of C12E6 and with overall concentration. The analysis of the SAXS and SANS data for pure C(12)G(2) shows that the micelles are disk-shaped. The presence of elongated micelles in pure C12E6 and in the mixtures demonstrates that the behavior of the mixtures is dominated by C12E6.'],\n",

The balance equations for production and loss of the populations of all levels in each state are solved in order to find the cascade contributions. Several sets of cross sections have been considered, and selected cross sections have been used to construct \"emission\" cross sections for the observed bands. The resulting brightnesses are compared with those measured by ASK. The importance of specific contributions from cascading is found, with more than 50% of the total brightness resulting from cascading.

Although natural reserves are often seen as preserving 'higher valued' rather than 'lower valued' nature, it is more adequate to describe them as outcomes of selective social articulation processes. This is illustrated in the Stockholm National Urban Park. Despite strong exploitation pressure, a diverse urban movement of civil society organizations has managed to provide narratives able to explain and legitimize the need for protection-a 'protective story'. On the basis of qualitative data and building on theories of value articulation, social movements, and actor-networks, we show how activists, by interlacing artefacts and discourses from cultural history and conservation biology, managed to simultaneously link spatially separated green areas previously seen as disconnected, while also articulating the interrelatedness between the cultural and the natural history of the area. This connective practice constructed holistic values articulating a unified park, which heavily influenced the official framing of the park's values and which now help to explain the success of the movement. In contrast to historically top-down-led designation of natural reserves, we argue that the involvement of civil society in protecting nature (and culture) is on the rise. This nonetheless begs the question of who can participate in these value-creating processes, and we also strive to uncover constraining and facilitating factors for popular participation. Four such factors are suggested: (i) the number and type of artefacts linked to an area; (ii) the capabilities and numbers of activists involved; (iii) the access to social arenas; and (iv) the social network position of actors.\"],\n",

The more specific question is how this framework has responded to the shift towards more deliberative approaches to planning and decision making, advocated in planning theory and policy literature over the last decade. The analysis, which compares the current framework and guidance with an earlier iteration, identifies a shift towards deliberation; deliberative norms are present, and even dominate recent guidance. However, an instrumental norm permeates both the former and the current guidance, suggesting that even as a language of consultation is replaced by one of deliberation, the intention remains to secure and legitimise a smooth development pathway. Evidence from interviews with professionals working in the Swedish EIA system highlights the difficulties of navigating these uncertainties in practice. By opening up critical analysis of deliberative norms as they shape the conditions for practice, this study contributes to the continuous development of planning practice, by supporting a more normatively reflexive approach to framework-design.'],\n",

The intensity-dependent self-focusing formation and multifocus structures of the infrared (IR) laser beam were directly observed in a three-photon active fluorescent dye solution cell, in which a high contrast image of the spatial structure of the self-focusing beam can be obtained due to the cubic dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the local IR laser intensity. By combining this dye solution cell with another cell filled with various transparent organic liquids, the contributions of these tested liquids to the observed self-focusing effect are elucidated. The numerical simulations for this type of self-focusing behavior are presented, based on the assumption that the major contribution to the observed self-focusing is the nonlinear refractive-index change of the solvent due to electronic-cloud distortion.

The models are based on the chemical compositions and microstructure characteristics which are calculated using thermodynamical calculations. The properties that were modelled are the general corrosion, the weldability (MIG and TIC) and the machinability. The results from these models are to be used in materials selection and optimisation. The models clearly show that the general corrosion resistance is reduced for all alloy additions, except for small amounts of titanium. The largest influence on the corrosion is from copper and zinc. The weldability is negatively influenced by the copper and zinc-content, and for small additions of zirconium and titanium it is increased. The machinability is positively influenced by the hardness of the alloy or by adding lead or bismuth. For the non-heat-treatable alloys there was no influence from the composition to the corrosion resistance or the weldability. Copper and zinc which are added to increase the strength to the alloy strongly reduce both the weldability and the corrosion resistance but due to the increase in hardness increase the workability.'],\n",

Materials whose substantial part of voids are gel pores (cementitious materials) act as a membrane during isotope transport separating lighter from heavier isotopes and therefore cause the fractionation of isotopes.

When waste water and grey water containing microorganisms are released, these microorganisms can remain viable in low-temperature Antarctic conditions for prolonged periods. Microorganisms may also have the potential to infect and cause disease, or become part of the gut flora of local bird and mammal populations, and fish and marine invertebrates. The results from 71 stations show that much can still be done by the 28 nations operating the 82 research stations in Antarctica. The technology exists for effective waste water treatment in the challenging Antarctic conditions. The use of efficient technology at all permanent Antarctic research stations would greatly reduce the human impact on the pristine Antarctic environment. In order to protect the Antarctic environment from infectious agents introduced by humans, consideration should also be given to preventing the release of untreated waste water and grey water from the smaller summer stations.'],\n",

Using space-vector transfer functions between superimposed oscillations in the control signal and the AC and DC sides, expressions for voltages and currents have been derived. The dynamic properties of the HVDC link, taking the characteristics of the networks on both the AC and the DC sides into consideration, can be studied by applying classical Bode/Nyquist/Nichols control methods. The resulting model was validated by time-domain studies in PSCAD/EMTDC. The model is described in two papers. In this paper (Part I), it has been assumed that the overlap angle during commutation remains constant. It is shown in the validation that this assumption introduces resonances that cause severe errors at certain network conditions.

We investigated possible adaptive aspects of such cross-generation transmissions, and hypothesized that chronic unpredictable food access would cause chickens to show a more conservative feeding strategy and to be more dominant, and that these adaptations would be transmitted to the offspring. Methodology/Principal Findings: Parents were raised in an unpredictable (UL) or in predictable diurnal light rhythm (PL, 12:12 h light: dark). In a foraging test, UL birds pecked more at freely available, rather than at hidden and more attractive food, compared to birds from the PL group. Female offspring of UL birds, raised in predictable light conditions without parental contact, showed a similar foraging behavior, differing from offspring of PL birds. Furthermore, adult offspring of UL birds performed more food pecks in a dominance test, showed a higher preference for high energy food, survived better, and were heavier than offspring of PL parents. Using cDNA microarrays, we found that the differential brain gene expression caused by the challenge was mirrored in the offspring. In particular, several immunoglobulin genes seemed to be affected similarly in both UL parents and their offspring. Estradiol levels were significantly higher in egg yolk from UL birds, suggesting one possible mechanism for these effects. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that unpredictable food access caused seemingly adaptive responses in feeding behavior, which may have been transmitted to the offspring by means of epigenetic mechanisms, including regulation of immune genes. This may have prepared the offspring for coping with an unpredictable environment.'],\n",

We present a method of removing metallic gallium from moderately damaged GaN surfaces by deposition of indium, and formation of an In-Ga alloy that can be desorbed by annealing at similar to 550 degrees C. After the In-Ga alloy has desorbed, photoemission spectra show that the Ga3d bulk component becomes narrower indicating a smoother and more homogeneous surface. This is also reflected in a sharper low energy electron diffraction pattern. On heavily damaged GaN surfaces, caused by hard sputtering, larger amount of metallic gallium forms after annealing at 600 degrees C.

The surface recombination velocity (SRV) at the exposed hole sidewalls is determined from the measured carrier lifetimes of the PhC fields with different lattice parameters. The observed variation in the SRV with etch duration also confirms the presence of accumulated sidewall damage. It increases from 6x10(3) to 1.2x10(5) cm s(-1) as the etching time increases from 3 to 50 min. A geometric model based on sputtering theory and on the evolution of the hole shape is developed to explain the accumulation of sidewall damage.

It is especially rewarding to capitalize on the remarkable similarity between the solid-state properties of compressed Ce and the actinide metals. The intensively studied alpha-gamma transition in Ce is considered to be a Mott transition, namely, the 4f electron changes its behavior from being localized to become delocalized (itinerant/metallic). This change also means that the 4f electron transforms from a non-bonding to a bonding configuration which, in turn, gives rise to a volume collapse. This collapse is isostructural in character, which contributes to the immense interest in this phase transition. An analogous and remarkable change in bonding (cohesive) properties is also found within the actinide series, where the sudden volume increase from Pu to Am (50%) can be viewed as a Mott transition within the 5f shell as a function of atomic number Z. The elements on the metallic side of the 5f Mott transition, i.e. the earlier actinides (Pa-Pu), show low symmetry structures at ambient conditions, while the heavier elements (from Am and beyond) adopt structures typical for the lighter trivalent lanthanide elements with localized 4f electrons.

These ions are the main carrier of the diamagnetic current causing the magnetic depletion, whereas the polarization is maintained by different behavior of energetic ions and electrons. Corresponding to aurora, field-aligned accelerated ionospheric plasma of several keV appeared at Cluster from both hemispheres simultaneously. Together with good correspondence in location and propagation velocity between the auroral bulge and the solitary structure, this indicates that the sunward moving auroral bulge is caused by the sunward propagation of the solitary structure which is maintained by energetic ions.

The latter is examined here by use of a periodic, axisymmetric model representing two grains. A microcrack nucleated at the center in one grain is driven by a constant remotely applied stress towards the second grain. The cleavage planes of the grain in which the microcrack is nucleated coincide with the principal loading direction. In the adjacent grain, due to misalignment in possible cleavage planes, the propagation direction changes and separation occurs in mixed mode, involving both normal and shear separations. The temperature dependence of the mechanical properties of the material is accounted for by use of a temperature dependent elasto viscoplastic material model. The largest grain size that can arrest a rapidly propagating microcrack is defined as the critical grain size. The effects of stress state and temperature on the critical grain size are examined. The influence of mismatch in lattice orientation between two adjacent grains in terms of a tilt angle is both qualitatively and quantitatively described. It is shown that the critical grain size is influenced by plastic geometry change and prestraining, which depend on the applied stress state. The results also show that a microcrack can be arrested in an adjacent grain under specific conditions.'],\n",

The groove-generated SPW is the main factor determining the local field distribution around the nano-slit opening. The influence of the incident wave is very weak when strong SPW is generated on the input surface by many periods of deep grooves.

The FIs were found very effective in ameliorating the detrimental effects of the toroidal ripple: the fast ion wall loads are reduced practically to their negligible axisymmetric level. The thermonuclear alpha particles overwhelmingly dominate the wall power flux. In scenario-4 practically all the power goes to the limiters, while in scenario-2 the load is fairly evenly divided between the divertor and the limiter, with hardly any power flux to other components in the first wall. This is opposite to earlier results, where hot spots were observed with 2D wall (Tobita et al 2003 Fusion Eng. Des. 65 561-8). In contrast, uncompensated ripple leads to unacceptable peak power fluxes of 0.5 MW m(-2) in scenario-2 and 1 MW m(-2) in scenario-4, with practically all power hitting the limiters and substantial flux arriving even at the unprotected first wall components. The local TBM structures were found to perturb the magnetic field structure globally and lead to increased wall loads.

The four winters investigated (2003-2007) covered a broad range of weather and snow conditions including several periods with intercepted snow lasting up to 19 days. For cloudless days, the data show that canopy albedo is elevated by the presence of intercepted snow. For transmissivity, the impact of intercepted snow is less distinct. Our analysis showed that the fraction of diffuse radiation and solar elevation are the main factors affecting shortwave transmissivity. Only after compensating for these effects, could intercepted snow be associated with increased transmissivities. Part of this analysis was carried out with the help of a physically based radiative transfer model.

In Sweden, about 47% of the household waste is treated by incineration with energy recovery. Most incineration plants are CHP, summing up to 0.3% of the total electricity generation. MSW is to a high extent a renewable fuel, but plastic, rubber etc. can amount to 50% of the carbon content in the waste. Recycling of plastic is in general environmentally favourable in comparison to landfill disposal or incineration. However, some plastic types are not possible to recycle and some plastic is of such low quality that it is not suitable for recycling. This paper focuses on the non-renewable and non-recyclable plastic in MSW. A CO2 assessment has been made for non-recyclable plastic where incineration with energy recovery has been compared to landfill disposal. In the assessment, consideration has been taken of alternative fuel in the incinerator, emissions from waste treatment and avoided emissions from heat and power supply. For landfill disposal of plastic the emissions of CO2 amounts to 253 g kg(-1) plastic. For incineration, depending on different discrete choices, the results vary from -673 g kg(-1) to 4605 g kg(-1). Results indicate that for typical Swedish and European conditions, incineration of plastics has net emissions of greenhouse gases. These emissions are also in general higher for incineration than for landfill disposal. However in situations where plastics are incinerated with high efficiency and high electricity to heat ratios, and the heat and the electricity from incineration of plastics are replacing heat and electricity in non-combined heat and power plants based on fossil fuels, incineration of plastics can give a net negative contribution of greenhouse gases. The results suggest that efforts should be made to increase recycling of plastics, direct incineration of plastics in places where it can be combusted with high efficiency and high electricity-to-heat ratios where it is replacing fossil fuels, and reconsider the present policies of avoiding landfill disposal of plastics.'],\n",

This phenomenon proves that the isometric force production is not only dependent on current muscle length and length time derivative, but depends on the preceding contraction history. Isolated extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles from mice (NMRI strain) were used to investigate the force produced by a muscle, and some parameters hypothetically influencing this history-dependent force modification. The muscles were pre-stimulated at a fixed length, then different stretch/shortening episodes were introduced, whereafter changes of the active force were recorded while the muscles were held isometrically to approach a steady-state force before de-stimulation. The mechanical work during active stretch and shortening was evaluated by integrating the product of force and ramp velocity over the length-varying period. The results show a negative linear correlation between the force modification and the mechanical work produced on or by the muscle, continuous between shortening and stretch. A corresponding modification of the passive force component following each stimulation was also observed. The conclusion is that the isometric force attained after stretch or shortening is well described by an asymptotic force which is determined by the mechanical work.'],\n",

A recent REACH guidance document includes recommended default assessment factors that cover subacute-subchronic, subchronic-chronic, and subacute-chronic extrapolations. The recommended assessment factors are smaller than in most previous proposals, since they are calibrated to achieve central estimates (50th percentile of the target distribution) rather than a higher percentile such as the 95th, as has been more common. These assessment factors are nevertheless presented as representing a \"widely agreed level of conservatism\", a statement that may lead to misunderstandings of what is achieved by using them in a risk assessment. Assessment factors have been based on evidence from animal studies with different designs, in particular with focus on different endpoints. Our re-analysis of experimental data shows that using mortality as an endpoint leads to smaller assessment factors than if the factors are derived from corresponding ratios for non-lethal toxicity.'],\n",

As the agent of the Irish potato famine in the mid-nineteenth century, P. infestans has had a tremendous effect on human history, resulting in famine and population displacement(1). To this day, it affects world agriculture by causing the most destructive disease of potato, the fourth largest food crop and a critical alternative to the major cereal crops for feeding the world's population(1). Current annual worldwide potato crop losses due to late blight are conservatively estimated at $6.7 billion(2). Management of this devastating pathogen is challenged by its remarkable speed of adaptation to control strategies such as genetically resistant cultivars(3,4). Here we report the sequence of the P. infestans genome, which at similar to 240 megabases (Mb) is by far the largest and most complex genome sequenced so far in the chromalveolates. Its expansion results from a proliferation of repetitive DNA accounting for similar to 74% of the genome. Comparison with two other Phytophthora genomes showed rapid turnover and extensive expansion of specific families of secreted disease effector proteins, including many genes that are induced during infection or are predicted to have activities that alter host physiology. These fast-evolving effector genes are localized to highly dynamic and expanded regions of the P. infestans genome. This probably plays a crucial part in the rapid adaptability of the pathogen to host plants and underpins its evolutionary potential.\"],\n",

This paper studies the influence of a mean flow field and unstable separated flow on the reactive properties of the expansion, formulated as an end correction. Theoretical and experimental results show that the expansion end correction is significantly affected by the flow and hydrodynamic waves excited at the edge of the expansion. The effects are different in three regions where the Strouhal number is small, of order 1, and large. The influence is most significant at Strouhal numbers of the order 1, with specific limiting values for large and small Strouhal numbers, respectively. In the analytic model, an important feature is the shear layer at the edge modeled as a vortex sheet with the unsteady Kutta condition applied at the edge. The influence of Mach number, Helmholtz number, and area expansion ratio is studied, and a quasistationary, small Strouhal number, approximation yields an expression for the end correction. Further, the influence of edge condition is explored, emphasizing the importance of interaction between sound and unsteady vorticity shedding at the edge of the area expansion.'],\n",

The excitation and de-excitation of the exciton states in the QDs by an external electromagnetic field contribute extra dielectric polarizations with respect to the background material, thus a contrast in the dielectric constant and the eventual formation of the photonic dispersion. By assuming periodic boundary conditions, it has been shown that the photonic dispersion of the QD dimer system is composed of modified but still characteristic dispersions of the two types of QDs in their separate photonic crystal formats. Starting from the transparent condition of type-II QDs, the photonic structure of the QD dimer system evolves from the one of type-I QDs to the composite dimer system. The modification due to the radiative interaction between the two types of the QDs is symmetric with respect to the change in the excitation degree of type-II QDs (increase/decrease the excitation degree from transparent status so that type-II QDs become optically gain/lossy).

Although reconciliation-based orthology methods are generally considered more accurate than distance-based ones, the traditional parsimony-based implementation of reconciliation-based orthology analysis (most parsimonious reconciliation [MPR]) suffers from a number of shortcomings. For example, 1) it is limited to orthology predictions from the reconciliation that minimizes the number of gene duplication and loss events, 2) it cannot evaluate the support of this reconciliation in relation to the other reconciliations, and 3) it cannot make use of prior knowledge (e.g., about species divergence times) that provides auxiliary information for orthology predictions. We present a probabilistic approach to reconciliation-based orthology analysis that addresses all these issues by estimating orthology probabilities. The method is based on the gene evolution model, an explicit evolutionary model for gene duplication and gene loss inside a species tree, that generalizes the standard birth-death process. We describe the probabilistic approach to orthology analysis using 2 experimental data sets and show that the use of orthology probabilities allows a more informative analysis than MPR and, in particular, that it is less sensitive to taxon sampling problems. We generalize these anecdotal observations and show, using data generated under biologically realistic conditions, that MPR give false orthology predictions at a substantial frequency. Last, we provide a new orthology prediction method that allows an orthology and paralogy classification with any chosen sensitivity/specificity combination from the spectra of achievable combinations.

This ammunition will eventually become obsolete and must be destroyed, preferably with minimal impact on the environment and in a safe way for personnel. The aim of this paper is to make a comparison of the environmental impacts in a life cycle perspective of three different methods of decommissioning/destruction of ammunition, and to identify the environmental advantages and disadvantages of each of these destruction methods: open detonation; static kiln incineration with air pollution control combined with metal recycling, and a combination of incineration with air pollution control, open burning, recovery of some energetic material and metal recycling. Data used are for the specific processes and from established LCA databases. Recycling the materials in the ammunition and minimising the spread of airborne pollutants during incineration were found to be the most important factors affecting the life cycle environmental performance of the compared destruction methods. Open detonation with or without metal recycling proved to be the overall worst alternative from a life cycle perspective. The results for the static kiln and combination treatment indicate that the kind of ammunition and location of the destruction plant might determine the choice of method, since the environmental impacts from these methods are of little difference in the case of this specific grenade. Different methods for destruction of ammunition have previously been discussed from a risk and safety perspective.

This work is a statistical study from Longyear-byen, Svalbard, Norway, during the solar minimum between January and March 2007, providing a good coverage in shadow height position and precipitation conditions. The High Throughput Imaging Echelle Spectrograph (HiTIES) measured three bands of N-2(+) 1N (0,1), (1,2) and (2,3), and one N-2 2P band (0,3) in the magnetic zenith. The brightness ratios of the N-2(+) bands are compared with a theoretical treatment with excellent results. Balance equations for all important vibrational levels of the three lowest electronic states of the N-2(+) molecule are solved for steady-state, and the results combined with ion chemistry modelling. Brightnesses of the (0,1), (1,2) and (2,3) bands of N-2(+) 1N are calculated for a range of auroral electron energies, and different values of shadow heights. It is shown that in sunlit aurora, the brightness of the (0,1) band is enhanced, with the scattered contribution increasing with decreasing energy of precipitation (10-fold enhancements for energies of 100 eV). The higher vibrational bands are enhanced even more significantly. In sunlit aurora the observed 1N (1,2)/(0,1) and (2,3)/(0,1) ratios increase as a function of decreasing precipitation energy, as predicted by theory. In non-sunlit aurora the N-2(+) species have a constant proportionality to neutral N-2. The ratio of 2P(0,3)/ 1N(0,1) in the morning hours shows a pronounced decrease, indicating enhancement of N-2(+) 1N emission. Finally we study the relationship of all emissions and their ratios to rotational temperatures. A clear effect is observed on rotational development of the bands. It is possible that greatly enhanced rotational temperatures may be a signature of ion upflows.'],\n",

Unlike previous approaches to head detection, the proposed approach explores the topology information of a scene to detect the position of the head. Among the different available topology representations, the Reeb graph technique is chosen and is adapted to low-resolution 3-D range images. Invariance of the graph under rotations is achieved by using a Morse radial distance function. To cope with the particular challenges such as the noise and the large variations in the density of the data, a voxel neighborhood connectivity notion is proposed.

Among several technologies in the present, the PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is the most appropriate for vehicles application, because it combines durability, high power density, high efficiency, good response and it works at relatively low temperatures. Besides that it is easy to turn it on and off and it is able to support present vibration in vehicles. A PEMFC's problem is the need of noble catalysts like platinum. Another problem is that CO needs to be in low concentration, requiring a more clean hydrogen to avoid fuel cell deterioration. One part of this paper was developed in Stockholm, where there are some buses within the CUTE (clean urban transport for Europe) project that has been in operation with FC since January 2004. Another part was developed in Guaratingueta, Brazil. Brazil intends to start up a program of FC buses. As conclusion, this paper shows the economical analysis comparing buses moved by fuel cells using hydrogen by different kinds of production.

The latter pathway, in particular, would be very efficient for long-term immobilization of U. In nature, Fe(II) is an important reducing agent for U(VI) because it frequently occurs either dissolved in natural waters, sorbed to matrix minerals, or structurally bound in many minerals. Redox reactions between U(VI) and Fe(II) depend not only on the availability of Fe(II) in the environment, but also on the chemical conditions in the aqueous solution. Under natural groundwater condition U(VI) forms complexes with many anionic ligands, which strongly affect its speciation. Carbonate, in particular, is known to form stable complexes with U, raising the question, if U(VI), when complexed by carbonate, can be reduced to UO2. The goal of this study was to find out if Fe(II) when structurally bound in a mineral (as magnetite, Fe3O4) or sorbed to a mineral surface (as corundum, Al2O3) can reduce U(VI) to U(IV) in the presence of HCO3-. Batch experiments were conducted under anaerobic conditions to observe U removal from the aqueous phase by the two minerals depending on HCO3- addition (1 mM), U concentration (0.01-30 mu M) and pH value (6-10). Immediately after the experiments, the mineral surfaces were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to obtain information on the redox state of U bound to the solid surfaces. XPS results gave evidence that U(VI) can be reduced both by magnetite and by corundum amended with Fe(II). In the presence of HCO3 the amount of reduced U on the mineral surfaces increased compared to carbonate-free solutions. This can be explained by the formation of Fe(II) carbonates on the mineral surfaces which represent an easily available Fe(II) pool for the U(VI) reduction. A facilitated U(VI) reduction is also considered possible when U is present as a carbonate complex compared to non-complexed U (e.g. uranyl).'],\n",

High Reynolds number turbulence is ubiquitous in aerospace engineering, ground transportation systems, flow machinery, energy production (from gas turbines to wind and water turbines), as well as in nature, e.g. various processes occurring in the planetary boundary layer. High Reynolds number turbulence is not easily obtained in the laboratory, since in order to have good spatial resolution for measurements, the size of the facility itself has to be large. In this paper, we discuss limitations of various existing facilities and propose a new facility that will allow good spatial resolution even at high Reynolds number.

For Gaussian models on Erdos-Renyi graphs, numerical computation points to a spectral gap remaining in the large- size limit, implying exceptionally good scalability. In a model where the underlying network also fluctuates (\"dynamic network\"), averaging is more effective than in the dynamic data case.

Two different current regimes could clearly be distinguished during the pulses: (1) a high-current transient followed by (2) a plateau at lower currents. These results provide a link between the HiPIMS and the direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) discharge regimes. At high applied negative voltages the high-current transient had the characteristics of HiPIMS pulses, while at lower voltages the plateau values agreed with currents in DCMS using the same applied voltage. The current behavior was found to be strongly correlated with the chamber gas pressure, where increasing gas pressure resulted in increasing peak current and plateau current. Based on these experiments it is suggested here that the high-current transients cause a depletion of the working gas in the area in front of the target, and thereby a transition to a DCMS-like high-voltage, lower current regime.'],\n",

In this paper, we model the development of an aneurysm as a cylindrical/spherical membrane subject to 1D enlargement; these conceptual models reflect the development of fusiform and saccular cerebral aneurysms. The mechanical response is attributed to the elastin and collagen. We introduce variables which define the elastin and collagen fibre concentration; these evolve to simulate growth/atrophy of the constituents. A hypothetical aneurysm model is analysed: collagen stretch is constant, elastin degrades and collagen fibre concentration can adapt to maintain mechanical equilibrium. An analytic expression for the rate of evolution of the fibre concentration is derived. The functional form is dependent on (i) the current collagen fibre concentration, (ii) the deviations in the collagen fibre stretch from the attachment stretch, (iii) the rate of change of fibre stretch, (iv) the rate of loss of elastin and (v) the ratio of load borne by elastinous and collagenous constituents. Finally, numerical examples of aneurysm development are considered. Suitable candidates for the fibre concentration evolution equations are identified that yield stabilization of the aneurysm even when there is complete loss of elastin. This theoretical analysis provides the basis for the development of physiologically realistic models of aneurysm development.'],\n",

Correcting for this inaccuracy within LDA + U calculations with an on-site Coulumb interaction U on the semicore d-states results in a modest enhancement of the band gap. We show that this modest enhancement of the band-gap energy comes from the movement of the valence-band maximum alone, thus not affecting the conduction-band states. Further, the localization of the charge on Ga d states with U leads to a regulation of charge on Ga. This yields a shift of 1-2 eV of the core levels on the Ga atom while the anion core levels remain unchanged.'],\n",

Both the transmitter as well as the receiver are assumed to know the channel matrix perfectly. It is well known that, for linear MIMO transceivers, a diagonal transmission (i.e., orthogonalization of the channel matrix) is optimal for some criteria. Surprisingly, it was shown five years ago that for the family of Schur-convex functions an additional rotation of the symbols is necessary. However, if the bit loading is optimized jointly with the linear transceiver, then this rotation is unnecessary. Similarly, for DF MIMO optimized transceivers a rotation of the symbols is sometimes needed. The main result of this paper shows that for a DF MIMO transceiver where the bit loading is jointly optimized with the transceiver filters, the rotation of the symbols becomes unnecessary, and because of this, also the DF part of the receiver is not required. The proof is based on a relaxation of the available bit rates on the individual substreams to the set of positive real numbers. In practice, the signal constellations are discrete and the optimal relaxed bit loading has to be rounded. It is shown that the loss due to rounding is small, and an upper bound on the maximum loss is derived. Numerical results are presented that confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate that orthogonal transmission and the truly optimal DF design perform almost equally well.'],\n",

TNF-alpha is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in several inflammatory diseases and, to this day, four TNF-alpha-blocking protein pharmaceuticals have been approved for clinical use. The phage selection generated 18 unique cysteine-free affibody sequences of which 12 were chosen, after sequence cluster analysis, for characterization as proteins. Biosensor binding studies of the 12 Escherichia coli-produced and IMAC (immobilized-metal-ion affinity chromatography)-purified affibody molecules revealed three variants that demonstrated the strongest binding to human TNF-alpha. These three affibody molecules were subjected to kinetic binding analysis and also tested for their binding to mouse, rat and pig TNF-alpha. For Z(TNF alpha:185), subnanomolar affinity (K-D = 0.1-0.5 nM) for human TNF-alpha was demonstrated, as well as significant binding to TNF-alpha from the other species. Furthermore, the binding site was found to overlap with the binding site for the TNF-alpha receptor, since this interaction could be efficiently blocked by the Z(TNF-alpha:185) affibody. When investigating six dimeric affibody constructs with different linker lengths, and one trimeric construct, it was found that the inhibition of the TNF-alpha binding to its receptor could be further improved by using dinners with extended linkers and/or a trimeric affibody construct.

A computational framework is proposed to explore the link between the evolution of a cerebral aneurysm and the influence of hemodynamic stimuli that act on the endothelial cells. An aneurysm evolution model, which utilizes a realistic microstructural model of the arterial wall, is combined with detailed 3D hemodynamic solutions. The evolution of the blood flow within the developing aneurysm determines the distributions of the WSS and the spatial WSS gradient (WSSG) that act on the endothelial cell layer of the tissue.

A human middle cerebral artery is modeled as a two-layer cylinder where the layers correspond to the media and the adventitia. The immediate loss of media in the location of the aneurysm is taken to be responsible for the initiation of the aneurysm growth. The aneurysm is regarded as a development of the adventitia, which is composed of several distinct layers of collagen fibers perfectly aligned in specified directions. The collagen fibers are the only load-bearing constituent in the aneurysm wall; their production and degradation depend on the stretch of the wall and are responsible for the aneurysm growth. The anisotropy of the surrounding media was modeled using the strain-energy function proposed by Holzapfel et al.

Elast., 61, pp. 1-48), which is valid for an elastic material with two families of fibers. It was shown that the inclusion of fibers in the media reduced the maximum principal Cauchy stress and the maximum shear stress in the aneurysm wall. The thickness increase in the aneurysm wall due to material growth was also decreased. Varying the fiber angle in the media from a circumferential direction to a deviation of 10 deg from the circumferential direction did, however, only show a little effect. Altering the axial in situ stretch of the artery had a much larger effect in terms of the steady-state shape of the aneurysm and the resulting stresses in the aneurysm wall. The peak values of the maximum principal stress and the thickness increase both became significantly higher for larger axial stretches. [DOI: 10.1115/1.'],\n",

In the model there are two parameters that need to be determined through experiments. A 1D diffusion boundary layer problem is presented and solved in order to show that a sufficient rate of water dissociation can be obtained with the model.

In addition to the mixing analysis inside the contraction, layer mixing is also investigated downstream, where the flow continues inside a constant cross-section channel. In order to generate the passive scalar, the airflow above the plate was heated and the temperature stratification in the wake was traced by measuring the temperature field using constant current anemometry. Using different plate lengths, we found that the degree of mixing, obtained at a given position in the straight channel, is a function of the distance from the plate trailing edge to the contraction outlet. For a plate which does not protrude into the straight channel, we demonstrate the existence of an optimal trailing edge-contraction outlet distance that results in the lowest possible degree of mixing at a given downstream position in the straight channel. This finding is also supported by a semi-empirical relationship based on our developed self-similar solution for mixing layers in planar contractions.',\n",

In this solution, it is shown that the total stress, the sum of laminar and Reynolds shear stresses, becomes self-similar. To investigate the accuracy of the analytical results, the wake of a flat plate located at the centreline of a planar contraction is studied using hot-wire anemometry.

Initially, the near-wall convection is an upward backflow, which originates from the combined effects of the steric-depleted layer and a hydrodynamically depleted region near the wall. The formation of the hydrodynamically depleted region is elucidated by a convection-diffusion investigation, in which fibers are classified according to the different directions in which they drift. For fibers with sufficiently large aspect ratio, the initial near-wall backflow keeps growing. However, the backflow reverses to downward flow at later times if the aspect ratio is small. This is due to the fiber-wall interactions which rotate fibers to such angles that make fibers drift away from the wall, inducing a dense region and a correspondingly downward flow outside the initial backflow. Moreover, the steric-depleted boundary condition is of secondary importance in the generation and evolution of the near-wall convection.',\n",
