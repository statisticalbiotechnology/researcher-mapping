Using this framework, where deposited energies differ from actual photon energies, we compare the performance of a silicon strip detector, including the influence of scatter inside the detector and charge sharing but disregarding signal pileup, with an ideal energy integrating detector. We show that although the detection efficiency for silicon rapidly drops for the acceleration voltages encountered in clinical computed tomography practice, silicon detectors could perform on a par with ideal energy integrating detectors for routine imaging tasks.

Except for the limited detection efficiency of approximately 0.8 for a spectrum of 80 kVp, the largest discrepancies from ideal spectral behaviour have been shown to be Compton interactions in the detector and electronic noise. Using the framework of cascaded system analysis, we reconstruct the 3D MTF and NPS of a silicon strip detector including the influence of scatter and charge sharing inside the detector. We compare the reconstructed noise and signal characteristics with a reconstructed 3D MTF and NPS of an ideal energy-integrating detector system with unity detection efficiency, no scatter or charge sharing inside the detector, unity presampling MTF and 1 x 1 mm(2) detector elements. The comparison is done by calculating the dose-normalized detectability index for some clinically relevant imaging tasks and spectra. This work demonstrates that although the detection efficiency of the silicon detector rapidly drops for the acceleration voltages encountered in clinical computed tomography practice, and despite the high fraction of Compton interactions due to the low atomic number, silicon detectors can perform on a par with ideal energy-integrating detectors for routine imaging tasks containing low-frequency components. For imaging tasks containing high-frequency components, the proposed silicon detector system can perform approximately 1.1-1.3 times better than a fully ideal energy-integrating system.']\n",

For large scale and low cost devices, structures with the use of earth abundant materials are attractive. In this study, we fabricated flexible and conductive nanopaper aerogels with incorporated carbon nanotubes (CNT). Such conductive nanopaper is made from aqueous dispersions with dispersed CNT and cellulose nanofibers. Such aerogels are highly porous with open channels that allow the deposition of a thin-layer of silicon through a plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) method. Meanwhile, the open channels also allow for an excellent ion accessibility to the surface of silicon. We demonstrated that such lightweight and flexible Si-conductive nanopaper structure performs well as Li-ion battery anodes. A stable capacity of 1200. mA. h/g for 100 cycles in half-cells is achieved. Such flexible anodes based on earth abundant materials and aqueous dispersions could potentially open new opportunities for low-cost energy devices, and potentially can be applied for large-scale energy storage.']\n",

      "[\"Visualizing individual molecules with chemical recognition is a longstanding target in catalysis, molecular nanotechnology and biotechnology. Molecular vibrations provide a valuable 'finger-print' for such identification. Vibrational spectroscopy based on tip-enhanced Raman scattering allows us to access the spectral signals of molecular species very efficiently via the strong localized plasmonic fields produced at the tip apex(1-11). However, the best spatial resolution of the tip-enhanced Raman scattering imaging is still limited to 3-15 nanometres(5,12-16), which is not adequate for resolving a single molecule chemically. Here we demonstrate Raman spectral imaging with spatial resolution below one nanometre, resolving the inner structure and surface configuration of a single molecule. This is achieved by spectrally matching the resonance of the nanocavity plasmon to the molecular vibronic transitions, particularly the downward transition responsible for the emission of Raman photons. This matching is made possible by the extremely precise tuning capability provided by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Experimental evidence suggests that the highly confined and broadband nature of the nanocavity plasmon field in the tunnelling gap is essential for ultrahigh-resolution imaging through the generation of an efficient double-resonance enhancement for both Raman excitation and Raman emission. Our technique not only allows for chemical imaging at the single-molecule level, but also offers a new way to study the optical processes and photochemistry of a single molecule.\"]\n",

LC is unidirectionally aligned via surface-treatment, and then gets GNRs organized with a negative order parameter in bulk through elastic force. The self-assembled GNRs (with a considerable high concentration of about 6 wt%) in LC exhibit a strong polarization-dependent localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Polarized optical microscopic imaging, polarization-dependent extinction and scattering spectra of LSPR are utilized to characterize the spatial orientation of GNRs. This method is compatible with the state-of-the-art LC display technique and allows for large-scale fabrication of optical metamaterials, plasmonic polarizers comprised of self-aligned anisometric nanoparticles with extremely low cost.']\n",

The reason is obvious: if the product is not appreciated by consumers they will search for another alternative which will decrease the estimated market share for a specific residential project. The main idea in this study is to increase our understanding of how to design and build more attractive residential developments by evaluating buyers' needs and preferences. Research concerning the means-end chain theory and the laddering technique has been quite extensive in the food industry but examples in residential development are rare. Laddering interviews were made with respondents who visited open house sales of a tenant-owned apartment on sale. We hypothesize that there exists a difference between bidders and non-bidders regarding their beliefs of functional and psychological consequences and abstract personal values. In our study we did not find any major difference in terminal values, but instrumental values do differ. This is true also for abstract product attributes and functional and psychological consequences. Professional developers and planners were able to use the beliefs of bidders and non-bidders to decide on a re-design of specific locations in the residential development of Frosunda, north of Stockholm, Sweden.\"]\n",

For SI-engines a regular WG turbocharger has been used, but in the future, when the boost level increases together with higher demand on the transient response, a Variable Nozzle Turbine (VNT) will be used together with Variable Valve Timing (VVT). As the degree of freedom increases, the control strategies during a transient load step will be more difficult to develop. A 1D simulation experiment has been conducted in GT Power where the transient simulation was \"frozen\" at certain time steps. The data from these time steps was put in a stationary simulation and the excessive energy was then bled off to obtain the same conditions for the engine in the stationary simulation as if the engine where in the middle of the transient. This method allows a faster and easier way to obtain a good control strategy for the VNT turbine and the VVT during a transient load step. The method can be used to find VNT/VVT settings strategies for the transient control with a good and robust result.']\n",

One potential means suggested to decrease the environmental impact related to accessibility is mediated meetings. However, few studies have quantified the potential environmental impacts with a life cycle perspective. With inspiration from a project involving four major Swedish media companies experiencing an increasing need for business travel and decreasing resources, this study assessed the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cumulative energy demand (CED) related to different types of business meetings, using a life cycle perspective. The potential consequences for emissions of GHG and CED in two hypothetical companies introducing mediated meetings were also assessed. The results indicated that mediated meetings using personal computers can reduce GHG emissions and CED per meeting and that more advanced mediated solutions are preferable to meetings which require travel, if the equipment is frequently used to replace travel. However, advanced technology that is under-used may give similar or higher GHG emissions and CED than meetings traveled to by train. All mediated meeting alternatives studied here had lower GHG emissions and CED than meetings which required travel by plane or car. LCD screen manufacture contributed the main environmental impact of mediated meetings, but the meeting rooms needed, electricity use for equipment and internet use for data transmission were also important in some cases. As LCD screen manufacture and internet energy use were main issues and as the data on these issues are uncertain, they should be further assessed+ and updated in future studies. Introduction of mediated meetings in companies and organizations should involve a thorough consideration of needs and possible solutions to achieve the best possible environmental benefits through efficient use and replacement of travel.']\n",

Green public procurement is a process whereby contracting authorities aim to procure services and products that meet environmental requirements. In recent years, green public procurement has extended to sustainable public procurement, which involves the incorporation of both environmental and social considerations in the procurement of goods and services. Previous studies have suggested the relevance of contractor engagement strategies and the need for appropriate models to promote dialogue in sustainable public procurement. This paper illustrates one such model called the competitive dialogue procedure. This newly introduced procurement procedure allows the contracting authority to hold discussions with shortlisted contractors regarding the authority's requirements. The paper uses the practical case of the Kvarnholmen link project in Sweden. The Kvarnholmen link is an infrastructure project that includes the construction of a bridge, tunnel, underpass and pedestrian and bike path. Action research was conducted to examine the competitive dialogue procedure. This paper has strengthened the conceptualisation that the procedure can facilitate sustainable public procurement with the aid of its key elements, such as provisionally preferred solution and dialogue sessions. In addition, the paper analyses the consequences of the weight used for environmental considerations in the bid evaluation process. This paper recommends that contracting authorities implementing competitive dialogue procedure must use provisionally preferred solution to identify sustainable public procurement preferences. Dialogue sessions with contractors should involve discussions regarding sustainable public procurement to ensure consistency between the weight for environmental considerations and respective preferences.\"]\n",

The major advantage of group-based control is its capability in providing flexible phase structures. The current group-based control systems are usually implemented with rather simple timing logics, e.g. vehicle actuated logic. However, such a timing logic is not sufficient to respond to the traffic environment whose inputs, i.e. traffic demands, dynamically change over time. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to formulate the existing group-based signal controller as a multi-agent system. The proposed signal control system is capable of making intelligent timing decisions by utilizing machine learning techniques. In this regard, reinforcement learning is a potential solution because of its self-learning properties in a dynamic environment. This paper, thus, proposes an adaptive signal control system, enabled by a reinforcement learning algorithm, in the context of group-based phasing technique. Two different learning algorithms, Q-learning and SARSA, have been investigated and tested on a four-legged intersection. The experiments are carried out by means of an open-source traffic simulation tool, SUMO. Performances on traffic mobility of the adaptive group- based signal control systems are compared against those of a well-established group-based fixed time control system. In the testbed experiments, simulation results reveal that the learning-based adaptive signal controller outperforms group-based fixed time signal controller with regards to the improvements in traffic mobility efficiency.

Combined with the phasing scheme, vehicle actuated timing is often adopted to respond to the detected traffic. However, the parameters of a signal controller are often predetermined in practice, and the control performance may suffer from deterioration when dealing with highly fluctuating traffic demand. This study proposes a group-based signal control approach capable of making decisions based on its understanding of traffic conditions at the intersection level. In particular, the control problem is formulated using a framework of stochastic optimal control for multi-agent system in which each signal group is modeled as an intelligent agent. The agents learn how to react to traffic environment and make optimal timing decisions according to the perceived system states. Reinforcement learning, enhanced by multiple-step backups, is employed as the kernel of the intelligent control algorithm, where each agent updates its knowledge on-line based on a sequence of states during the process. In addition, the proposed system is designated to be compatible with the prevailing signal system. A case study was carried out in a simulation environment to compare the proposed control approach with a benchmark controller used in practice, group-based vehicle actuated (GBVA) controller, whose parameters were off-line optimized using a genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive group-based control system outperforms the optimized GBVA control system mainly because of its real-time adaptive learning capacity in response to the changes in traffic demand.']\n",

The understanding of the performance of self-triggered control systems when the feedback loops are closed over IEEE 802.15.4 WSNs is of major interest, since the communication standard IEEE 802.15.4 is the de-facto reference protocol for energy-efficient WSNs. In this paper, a new approach to control several processes over a shared IEEE 802.15.4 network by self-triggered sampling is proposed. It is shown that the sampling time of the processes, the protocol parameters, and the scheduling of the transmissions must be jointly selected to achieve a good performance of the closed-loop system and an energy-efficient utilization of the network. The challenging part of the proposed analysis is ensuring globally uniformly ultimately boundedness of the controlled processes while providing efficient scheduling of the process state transmissions. Such a scheduling is difficult when asynchronous multiple control loops share the network, because transmissions over IEEE 802.15.4 are allowed only at certain time slots. The proposed approach establishes that the joint design of self-triggered samplers and the network protocol (1) ensures globally uniformly ultimately boundedness of each control loop, (2) reduces the number of sensor transmissions, and (3) increases the sleep time of the transmitting nodes. A new dynamic scheduling problem is proposed for the joint control of each process and network protocol adaptation. An algorithm is derived, which adapts the network parameters according to the self-triggered sampler of every control loop. Numerical examples illustrate the analysis and show the benefits of the approach. It is concluded that self-triggered control strategies over WSNs ensure desired control performance, reduce the network utilization, and reduce energy consumption only if the protocol parameters are appropriately regulated.']\n",

A hybrid scheme that combines these two strategies is also considered. The probabilistic delay and effective capacity are used to evaluate performance. For probabilistic delay, the violation probability of delay, i.e., the probability that the delay exceeds a given tolerance level, is characterized in terms of upper bounds, which are derived by applying stochastic network calculus theory. In addition, to characterize the maximum affordable arrival traffic for mmwave systems, the effective capacity, i.e., the service capability with a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, is studied. The derived bounds on the probabilistic delay and effective capacity are validated through simulations. These numerical results show that, for a given sum power budget, traffic dispersion, network densification, and the hybrid scheme exhibit different potentials to reduce the end-to-end communication delay. For instance, traffic dispersion outperforms network densification when high sum power budget and arrival rate are given, while it could be the worst option, otherwise. Furthermore, it is revealed that, increasing the number of independent paths and/or relay density is always beneficial, while the performance gain is related to the arrival rate and sum power, jointly. Therefore, a proper transmission scheme should be selected to optimize the delay performance, according to the given conditions on arrival traffic and system service capability.']\n",

Ultra-high field Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (17.6 T DT-MRI) is performed on a specimen of human articular cartilage before and after indentation to similar to 20% compression. Based on this DT-MRI data, we detail a novel FE approach to determine the geometry (edge detection from first eigenvalue), the meshing (semi-automated smoothing of DTI measurement voxels), and the fiber structural input (estimated principal fiber direction and dispersion). The global and fiber fabric deformations of both the un-dispersed and dispersed fiber models provide a satisfactory match to that estimated experimentally. In both simulations, the fiber fabric in the superficial and middle zones becomes more aligned with the articular surface, although the dispersed model appears more consistent with the literature.

Without a complete process model for verification, however, the performance of hybrid LCA remains unclear. Here, using a counterexample we show that hybrid LCA does not necessarily provide more accurate results than process-based LCA, simply because the aggregation of heterogeneous processes in IO models may introduce more errors. In so doing, we prove that only when IO-based LCA and process-based LCA have the same level of detail would they yield the same results. Whether hybrid LCA provides more accurate estimates depends on whether the IO model introduced serves as an adequate proxy for the missing products as opposed to if they were estimated by a complete process model. The use of a highly-aggregated IO model runs the risk of overestimation, and could result in a larger relative error than the truncation error resulting from an incomplete process model. Our study seeks to provide a balanced view of hybrid LCA, and our findings offer important insights for future hybrid LCA studies to improve the accuracy and realm of applicability of the approach.']\n",

      "[\"Far-field optical microscopy using focused light is an important tool in a number of scientific disciplines including chemical, (bio) physical and biomedical research, particularly with respect to the study of living cells and organisms. Unfortunately, the applicability of the optical microscope is limited, since the diffraction of light imposes limitations on the spatial resolution of the image. Consequently the details of, for example, cellular protein distributions, can be visualized only to a certain extent. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed the development of 'super-resolution' farfield optical microscopy (nanoscopy) techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground state depletion (GSD), reversible saturated optical (fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT), photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) or saturated structured illumination microscopy (SSIM), all in one way or another addressing the problem of the limited spatial resolution of far-field optical microscopy. While SIM achieves a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy, STED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of optical image resolution to the nanometer scale. Consequently, all super-resolution techniques open new avenues of biomedical research. Because the field is so young, the potential capabilities of different super-resolution microscopy approaches have yet to be fully explored, and uncertainties remain when considering the best choice of methodology. Thus, even for experts, the road to the future is sometimes shrouded in mist. The super-resolution optical microscopy roadmap of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics addresses this need for clarity.

Here we study the onset of magnetic order at finite temperatures in these systems on a first-principles basis calculating the interatomic magnetic exchange interactions in the high-temperature paramagnetic regime. We employ the disordered local moment formalism and the magnetic force theorem within the framework of the local spin-density approximation and Monte Carlo simulations taking also the effects of atomic disorder in fcc alloys into account. In particular we find the origin of the stabilization of the noncollinear 3k structure in competition between antiferromagnetic inter- and in-plane couplings of frustrated kagome planes in hexagonal Mn3Ga and predict the antiferromagnetic-1 collinear order due to frustration in fcc alloys.

The aim of this study was to engineer and investigate an expression vector system with dual functionalities: i) recombinant display of Affibody libraries on Escherichia coli for directed evolution and ii) small scale secreted production of candidate affinity proteins, allowing initial downstream characterizations prior to subcloning. Autotransporters form a class of surface proteins in Gram-negative bacteria that have potential for efficient translocation and tethering of recombinant passenger proteins to the outer membrane. We engineered a bacterial display vector based on the E. coli AIDA-I autotransporter for anchoring to the bacterial surface. Potential advantages of employing autotransporters combined with E. coli as host include: high surface expression level, high transformation frequency, alternative promoter systems available, efficient translocation to the outer membrane and tolerance for large multi-domain passenger proteins. Results: The new vector was designed to comprise an expression cassette encoding for an Affibody molecule, three albumin binding domains for monitoring of surface expression levels, an Outer membrane Protease T (OmpT) recognition site for potential protease-mediated secretion of displayed affinity proteins and a histidine-tag for purification. A panel of vectors with different promoters were generated and evaluated, and suitable cultivation conditions were investigated. The results demonstrated a high surface expression level of the different evaluated Affibody molecules, high correlation between target binding and surface expression level, high signal-to-background ratio, efficient secretion and purification of binders in OmpT-positive hosts as well as tight regulation of surface expression for the titratable promoters. Importantly, a mock selection using FACS from a 1: 100,000 background yielded around 20,000-fold enrichment in a single round and high viability of the isolated bacteria after sorting. Conclusions: The new expression vectors are promising for combinatorial engineering of Affibody molecules and the strategy for small-scale production of soluble recombinant proteins has the potential to increase throughput of the entire discovery process.']\n",

The method is based on fusion of aggregation-prone peptides to a fluorescent protein, functioning as a solubility reporter. Co-expression of a protein-based aggregation-inhibitor should prevent aggregation and thus increase the whole-cell fluorescence. We evaluated the method using the aggregation-prone Alzheimer's-related amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide in fusion to green-fluorescent protein (GFP), and an AÎ² aggregation-inhibiting Affibody molecule. To adapt the method for library applications, the inhibitor was linked to an mCherry reporter for normalization of protein expression levels.

The first domain functions as a reporter tag and has affinity for a labeled reporter protein, whereas the second domain blocks the reporter tag from interacting with the reporter protein. Site-specific proteolysis of the substrate results in release of the blocking domain, enabling the reporter tag to bind the labeled reporter protein. Proteolysis is therefore reflected in reporter binding, which is quantified by flow cytometry.

      "['Based on a Lagrangian description of fluid particle dispersion we suggest that there is a single expression for the vertical eddy diffusivity for all scalars following fluid particles in stably stratified flows. This expression is the same as the Osborn-Cox diffusivity for buoyancy. To test this hypothesis we carry out turbulence simulations with stable background stratification by solving the Boussinesq equations with random forcing together with the equation for a passive scalar with an initial vertical Gauss profile. The development of the mean scalar concentration is studied for three different values of the width of the profile, sigma. It is found that the passive scalar diffuses in very good agreement with the classical diffusion equation if the ratio between s and a turbulent length scale is large enough. The associated eddy diffusivity agrees exactly with the Osborn-Cox diffusivity for buoyancy. Citation: Lindborg, E., and E.

However, finding efficient pilot reuse patterns is non-trivial, especially in practical asymmetric BS deployments. We approach this problem using the coalitional game theory. Each BS has a few unique pilots and can form coalitions with other BSs to gain access to more pilots. The BSs in a coalition, thus, benefit from serving more users in their cells at the expense of higher pilot contamination and interference.

The ILT progression mechanism is still unclear and little is known regarding the impact of the chemical species transported by blood flow on this mechanism. Chemical agonists and antagonists of platelets activation, aggregation, and adhesion and the proteins involved in the coagulation cascade (CC) may play an important role in ILT development. Starting from this assumption, the evolution of chemical species involved in the CC, their relation to coherent vortical structures (VSs) and their possible effect on ILT evolution have been studied. To this end a fluid-chemical model that simulates the CC through a series of convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations has been developed. The model involves plasma-phase and surface-bound enzymes and zymogens, and includes both plasma-phase and membrane-phase reactions. Blood is modeled as a non-Newtonian incompressible fluid. VSs convect thrombin in the domain and lead to the high concentration observed in the distal portion of the AAA. This finding is in line with the clinical observations showing that the thickest ILT is usually seen in the distal AAA region. The proposed model, due to its ability to couple the fluid and chemical domains, provides an integrated mechanochemical picture that potentially could help unveil mechanisms of ILT formation and development.']\n",

      "[\"BACKGROUND: Low birth weight (LBW) is associated with cardiovascular morbidity in adulthood. Imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) has been implicated as a mechanism behind the developmental programming of cardiovascular function. We hypothesized that deviations in the ANS function are seen in children born with LBW. METHODS: Eighty-six children were included: 31 born pre-term (&lt;32 wk gestational age), 27 born at term but small for gestational age (SGA), and 28 born at term with normal birth weight (control). Twenty-four-hour Holter-electrocardiogram monitoring was performed at an average age of 9 y. Heart rate variability results were analyzed using frequency and time domain methods. RESULTS: All frequency components and both time domain parameters tested were significantly lower in the preterm and SGA children compared with controls. The low frequency/high frequency ratio was not significantly different between children born with LBW and controls. CONCLUSION: The autonomic control appears to be affected in children born with LBW despite gestational age at birth. Decreased total power, as an estimation of the ANS's global activity, rather than the balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic modulation might be an early marker of cardiovascular disease later on in life for LBW born children.\"]\n",

Arterial desaturation in the upper body is frequently seen in patients with peripheral arterial cannulation and severe respiratory failure. The importance of venous cannula positioning was explored in a computer simulation model and a clinical case was described. A closed-loop real-time simulation model has been developed including vascular segments, the heart with valves and pericardium. ECMO was simulated with a fixed flow pump and a selection of clinically relevant venous cannulation sites. A clinical case with no tidal volumes due to pneumonia and an arterial saturation of below 60% in the right hand despite VA-ECMO flow of 4 L/min was described. The case was compared with simulation data. Changing the venous cannulation site from the inferior to the superior caval vein increased arterial saturation in the right arm from below 60% to above 80% in the patient and from 64 to 81% in the simulation model without changing ECMO flow. The patient survived, was extubated and showed no signs of hypoxic damage. We conclude that venous drainage from the superior caval vein improves upper body arterial saturation during veno-arterial ECMO as compared with drainage solely from the inferior caval vein in patients with respiratory failure. The results from the simulation model are in agreement with the clinical scenario.']\n",

Six variants of the versatile enzyme Candida Antarctica lipase B (CALB) have been rationally engineered in silico based on the specific characteristics of the pericyclic addition. A kinetic analysis reveals that hydrogen bond stabilization of the transition state and substrate binding are key components of the catalytic process. In the case of substrate binding, which has the greater potential for optimization, both binding strength and positioning of the substrates are important for catalytic efficiency. The binding strength is determined by hydrophobic interactions and can be tuned by careful selection of solvent and substrates. The MD simulations show that substrate positioning is sensitive to cavity shape and size, and can be controlled by a few rational mutations. The well-documented S105A mutation is essential to enable sufficient space in the vicinity of the oxyanion hole. Moreover, bulky residues on the edge of the active site hinders the formation of a sandwich-like nearattack conformer (NAC), and the I189A mutation is needed to obtain enough space above the face of the alpha,beta-double bond on the dienophile. The double mutant S105A/I189A performs quite well for two of three dienophiles. Based on binding constants and NAC energies obtained from MD simulations combined with activation energies from DFT computations, relative catalytic rates (v (cat) /v (uncat) ) of up to 103 are predicted.']\n",

From this image, processing algorithms are used to extract information such as location of edges. The drawback of this technique is the vast amount of data captured but never used.

The presence of EDTA, which normally can form a complex with FeCl<sub>2</sub>, had no influence on the polymerization results as both the mediator and EDTA were insoluble in the polymerization medium. A mechanism is suggested for the heterogeneous polymerization of styrene mediated by iron (II)-chloride in p-xylene at 50 °C. Varying the mediator amount more than 10-fold revealed that the rate limiting step at low mediator amounts was the adsorption of the initiator or dormant polymer to the mediator surface, whereas at higher mediator amounts, the rate limiting step was instead the activation step in the ATRP equilibrium. The mechanism changed to free radical polymerization in solution at a certain conversion, resulting in lower apparent rate constant and an increased amount of transfer and termination reactions. Chain extension with MMA showed that a significant proportion of the polymer chain ends were active also at high conversions.']\n",

The implementation in nanostructured hybrid materials provides a remarkable increase of magneto-optical effects. However, so far only the enhancement of already known effects has been demonstrated in such materials. Here we postulate a novel magneto-optical phenomenon that originates solely from suitably designed nanostructured metal-dielectric material, the so-called magneto-plasmonic crystal. In this material, an incident light excites coupled plasmonic oscillations and a waveguide mode. An in-plane magnetic field allows excitation of an orthogonally polarized waveguide mode that modifies optical spectrum of the magneto-plasmonic crystal and increases its transparency. The experimentally achieved light intensity modulation reaches 24%. As the effect can potentially exceed 100%, it may have great importance for applied nanophotonics. Further, the effect allows manipulating and exciting waveguide modes by a magnetic field and light of proper polarization.']\n",

Direct numerical simulations of exothermic reacting turbulent wall-jets are performed and compared to the isothermal reacting case. An evaluation of the heat-release effects on the structure of turbulence is given by examining the mixture fraction surface characteristics, diagnosing vortices and exploring the dissipation rate of the fuel and passive scalar concentrations, and moreover by illustration of probability density functions of reacting species and scatter plots of the local temperature against the mixture fraction. Primarily, heat release effects delay the transition, enlarge the fluctuation intensities of density and pressure and also enhance the fluctuation level of the species concentrations. However, it has a damping effect on all velocity fluctuation intensities and the Reynolds shear stress. A key result is that the fine-scale structures of turbulence are damped, the surface wrinkling is diminished and the vortices become larger due to heat-release effects. Taking into account the varying density by using semi-local scaling improves the collapse of the turbulence statistics in the inner region, but does not eliminate heat release induced differences in the outer region. Examining the two-dimensional premultiplied spanwise spectra of the streamwise velocity fluctuations indicates a shifting in the positions of the outer peaks, associated with large energetic structures, toward the inner region.']\n",

The presence of proteins encoded by 15,841 genes in tumors from 27 HCC patients is evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Personalized GEMs for six HCC patients and GEMs for 83 healthy cell types are reconstructed based on HMR 2.0 and the tINIT algorithm for task-driven model reconstruction. 101 antimetabolites are predicted to inhibit tumor growth in all patients. Antimetabolite toxicity is tested using the 83 cell type-specific GEMs. An l-carnitine analog inhibits the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Abstract Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) have proven useful as scaffolds for the integration of omics data for understanding the genotype-phenotype relationship in a mechanistic manner. Here, we evaluated the presence/absence of proteins encoded by 15,841 genes in 27 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients using immunohistochemistry. We used this information to reconstruct personalized GEMs for six HCC patients based on the proteomics data, HMR 2.0, and a task-driven model reconstruction algorithm (tINIT). The personalized GEMs were employed to identify anticancer drugs using the concept of antimetabolites; i.e., drugs that are structural analogs to metabolites. The toxicity of each antimetabolite was predicted by assessing the in silico functionality of 83 healthy cell type-specific GEMs, which were also reconstructed with the tINIT algorithm. We predicted 101 antimetabolites that could be effective in preventing tumor growth in all HCC patients, and 46 antimetabolites which were specific to individual patients. Twenty-two of the 101 predicted antimetabolites have already been used in different cancer treatment strategies, while the remaining antimetabolites represent new potential drugs.

Systems biology-based analyses could play an important role in the holistic analysis of the impact of HCV on hepatocellular metabolism. Here, we integrated HCV assembly reactions with a genome-scale hepatocyte metabolic model to identify metabolic targets for HCV assembly and metabolic alterations that occur between different HCV progression states (cirrhosis, dysplastic nodule, and early and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) and healthy liver tissue. We found that diacylglycerolipids were essential for HCV assembly. In addition, the metabolism of keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate was significantly changed in the cirrhosis stage, whereas the metabolism of acyl-carnitine was significantly changed in the dysplastic nodule and early HCC stages. Our results explained the role of the upregulated expression of BCAT1, PLOD3 and six other methyltransferase genes involved in carnitine biosynthesis and S-adenosylmethionine metabolism in the early and advanced HCC stages. Moreover, GNPAT and BCAP31 expression was upregulated in the early and advanced HCC stages and could lead to increased acyl-CoA consumption. By integrating our results with copy number variation analyses, we observed that GNPAT, PPOX and five of the methyltransferase genes (ASH1L, METTL13, SMYD2, TARBP1 and SMYD3), which are all located on chromosome 1q, had increased copy numbers in the cancer samples relative to the normal samples. Finally, we confirmed our predictions with the results of metabolomics studies and proposed that inhibiting the identified targets has the potential to provide an effective treatment strategy for HCV-associated liver disorders.']\n",

Any potential human exposure to ferrochromium alloy particles is related to occupational activities during production and use, with 2 main exposure routes, dermal contact and inhalation and subsequent digestion. Alloy and reference particles exposed in vitro in synthetic biological fluids relevant for these main exposure routes have been investigated in a large research effort combining bioaccessibility; chemical speciation; and material, surface, and particle characteristics. In this paper, data for the dermal exposure route, including skin and eye contact, will be presented and discussed. Bioaccessibility data have been generated for particles of a ferrochromium alloy, stainless steel grade AISI 316L, pure Fe, pure Cr, iron(II,III)oxide, and chromium(III)oxide, upon immersion in artificial sweat (pH 6.5) and artificial tear (pH 8.0) fluids for various time periods. Measured released amounts of Fe, Cr, and Ni are presented in terms of average Fe and Cr release rates and amounts released per amount of particles loaded. The results are discussed in relation to bulk and surface composition of the particles. Additional information, essential to assess the bioavailability of Cr released, was generated by determining its chemical speciation and by providing information on its complexation and oxidation states in both media investigated. The effect of differences in experimental temperature, 30 °C and 37 °C, on the extent of metal release in artificial sweat is demonstrated. Iron was the preferentially released element in all test media and for all time periods and ironcontaining particles investigated. The extent of metal release was highly pH dependent and was also dependent on the medium composition. Released amounts of Cr and Fe were very low (close to the limit of detection, &lt;0.008% of particles released or dissolved as iron or chromium) for the alloy particles (ferrochromium alloy and stainless steel), the pure Cr particles, and the metal oxide particles. The released fraction of Cr (Cr/[Cr + Fe]) varied with the material investigated, the test medium, and the exposure time and cannot be predicted from either the bulk or the surface composition. Chromium was released as noncomplexed Cr(III) and in addition in very low concentrations (&lt;3 mg/L). Nickel released was under the limit of detection (0.5 mg/L), except for ultrafine stainless steel particles (&lt;10 mg/L).

This process involves detailed assessment of potential hazards for various toxicity endpoints induced by the use of chemicals with a minimum use of animal testing. Such an assessment requires thorough understanding of relevant exposure scenarios including material characteristics and intrinsic properties and how, for instance, physical and chemical properties change from the manufacturing phase, throughout use, to final disposal. Temporary or permanent adverse health effects induced by particles depend either on their shape or physical characteristics, and/or on chemical interactions with the particle surface upon human exposure. Potential adverse effects caused by the exposure of metal particles through the gastrointestinal system, the pulmonary system, or the skin, and their subsequent potential for particle dissolution and metal release in contact with biological media, show significant gaps of knowledge. In vitro bioaccessibility testing at conditions of relevance for different exposure scenarios, combined with the generation of a detailed understanding of intrinsic material properties and surface characteristics, are in this context a useful approach to address aspects of relevance for accurate risk and hazard assessment of chemicals, including metals and alloys and to avoid the use of in vivo testing. Alloys are essential engineering materials in all kinds of applications in society, but their potential adverse effects on human health and the environment are very seldom assessed. Alloys are treated in REACH as mixtures of their constituent elements, an approach highly inappropriate because intrinsic properties of alloys generally are totally different compared with their pure metal components. A large research effort was therefore conducted to generate quantitative bioaccessibility data for particles of ferro-chromium alloys compared with particles of the pure metals and stainless steel exposed at in vitro conditions in synthetic biological media of relevance for particle inhalation and ingestion. All results are presented combining bioaccessibility data with aspects of particle characteristics, surface composition, and barrier properties of surface oxides. Iron and chromium were the main elements released from ferro-chromium alloys upon exposure in synthetic biological media. Both elements revealed time-dependent release processes. One week exposures resulted in very small released particle fractions being less than 0.3% of the particle mass at acidic conditions and less than 0.001% in near pH-neutral media. The extent of Fe released from ferro-chromium alloy particles was significantly lower compared with particles of pure Fe, whereas Cr was released to a very low and similar extent as from particles of pure Cr and stainless steel. Low release rates are a result of a surface oxide with passive properties predominantly composed of chromium(III)-rich oxides and silica and, to a lesser extent, of iron(II,III)oxides.

These values were then correlated to each other and to the RDA-value. A comparison between RDA, Ra and volume measurements was performed using linear fitting procedure. Results: The results showed that the correlation between RDA and Ra measurements was low (R-2 = 0.04) and also that the correlation between RDA and volume measurements was low (R-2 = 0.00002). Correlation between Ra and abraded volume was high (R-2 = 0.87). Conclusions: It is important to consider not only the RDA-value when evaluating toothpaste abrasivity.

Materials and Methods: Acrylic plates were exposed to brushing in a brushing machine with ten different toothbrushes with water alone and with a toothpaste.

A surface roughness value (Ra-value) and also a volume loss value were calculated from the profilometer measurements. These values were then compared to each other. Results: The results showed that brushing with water alone caused less abrasion than when a toothpaste was added. Six-hour brushing with water caused less abrasion than 1 h with a toothpaste. The number of filaments or filament diameter influenced the results in various ways. When brushing with water, the harder toothbrush (Jordan Medium) caused more abrasion (higher Ra-value), but when adding the toothpaste, the softer toothbrush (Jordan soft) caused more abrasion after 12 000 double strokes. Conclusion: Besides supporting the fact that a toothpaste is needed to create a significant abrasion, this study also showed that a softer toothbrush can cause as much and in some cases more abrasion than harder ones. When conducting abrasivity studies, it is important to look at both the quantitative and qualitative aspect of abrasivity.']\n",

      "[\"Objective. To evaluate the relative abrasivity of different toothpastes and polishing pastes both qualitatively and quantitatively. Materials and methods. Acrylic plates were exposed to brushing in a brushing machine with a toothpaste/water slurry for 1 and 6 h. Twelve different toothpastes were used and also four different polishing pastes. The results were evaluated using a profilometer after 1 and 6 h of brushing (corresponding to 2000 and 12 000 double strokes, respectively). A surface roughness value (Ra-value) and also a volume loss value were calculated from the profilometer measurements. These values were then correlated to each other. An unpaired t-test for the difference in the abrasion values between the toothpastes and the abrasion values over time was used. Results. The polishing paste RDA (R) 170 yielded higher Ra-values than RDA 250 (R), both after 1 and 6 h of brushing (1.01 +/- 0.22 and 8.99 +/- 1.55 compared to 0.63 +/- 0.26 and 7.83 +/- 5.89, respectively) as well as volume loss values (3.71 +/- 0.17 and 20.20 +/- 2.41 compared to 2.15 +/- 1.41 and 14.79 +/- 11.76, respectively), thus poor correlations between the RDA and Ra and Volume loss values were shown. Among the toothpastes, Apotekets (R) showed the highest Ra value after 1 h of brushing and Pepsodent (R) whitening after 6 h of brushing. Pepsodent (R) whitening also showed the highest volume loss values, both after 1 and 6 h of brushing. Conclusion. This study emphasizes the importance of not only considering the RDA value, but also a roughness value, when describing the abrasivity of a toothpaste. Furthermore, it can be concluded that so called 'whitening' toothpastes do not necessarily have a higher abrasive effect than other toothpastes.\"]\n",

In the present work, the fossil-based PAA middle layer was replaced by sustainable wood-based cellulose nano-fibrils (CNF), i. e., the fibers were modified by a 3-layer PVAm/CNF/PVAm system. Interestingly, the antibacterial efficacy of this system was greater than that of the previous PVAm/PAA/PVAm system. A higher salt concentration and lower assembly pH in the multilayer build-up resulted in better bacterial reduction. As the surface of a cellulose fiber is heterogeneous, making it difficult to characterize and visualize at high resolution, more homogeneous cellulose model surfaces were prepared by spin coating the dissolved cellulose fiber onto a silica surface to model the fiber surface. With increasing ionic strength, more aggregated and heterogeneous structures can be observed on the PVAm/CNF/PVAm modified model surfaces. The adsorbed bacteria distributed on the structured surfaces were clearly seen under fluorescence microscopy. Adsorbed amounts of bacteria on either aggregate or flat regions were quantified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). More adsorbed bacteria were clearly seen on aggregates than on the flat regions at the surfaces. Degrees of bacteria deformation and cell damage were also seen under SEM. The surface roughness of the modified model surfaces was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and a positive correlation was found between the surface roughness and the bacterial adhesion. Thus, an additional factor that controls adhesion, in addition to the surface charge, which is probably the most dominant factor affecting the bacteria adhesion, is the surface structures, such as roughness.']\n",

The Rh metal loading of the monometallic washcoats was varied between 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 wt%, while the weight ratio of Rh:Pt in the bimetallic washcoats was kept constant at 1:1. Furthermore, non-doped and CeLa-doped catalysts were also tested to detect differences in catalyst activity. The catalysts consisting of two layers of washcoats were termed zoned catalysts and each layer was applied to some given length in the axial direction of the monolith. All catalysts were prepared by impregnation using the incipient wetness technique with delta-Al2O3 B as support and deposited onto 400 cpsi cordierite monoliths. A total of eight catalysts, including both single layered and zone-coated, were tested in a bench-scale reactor using low-sulfur diesel as fuel at operating conditions H2O/C=2.5, O-2/C=0.49 (lambda = 0.33), GHSV 17,000 h(-1) and P = 1 atm.

Interestingly, these effects were less significant on the ME samples. The characterization results clearly showed differences in morphology between the ME and the IW samples. N(2)-BET analysis showed that higher surface area, similar to 268-285 m(2)/g, was obtained with the ME samples.

Furthermore, the catalyst activity of the unpromoted samples, in terms of diesel conversion, increased in the following order: RhPt/SiO(2) &lt; RhPt/TiO(2) &lt; RhPt/Al(2)O(3) &lt; RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2). The addition of promoters was found to be insignificant as well as having a negative impact on the catalyst performance in most cases, except for the alumina-promoted sample. The addition of 10 wt% La(2)O(3) on RhPt/Al(2)O(3) was found to enhance diesel conversion, hydrogen productivity as well as lower the ethylene concentration from 3700 ppm to less than half that value.

N(2)-BET analysis showed that the surface area of RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) was 64 m(2)/g, while the silica samples exhibited the highest area, similar to 137-185 m(2)/g. Hence, the difference in the surface areas was not enough to explain the trends observed in the activity measurements. XRD analysis of RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) showed crystalline phases characteristic of zirconia, most likely tetragonal. Also, the diffractogram did not reveal any Rh or Pt peaks indicating that the noble metal particles are highly dispersed on the support. In contrast, peaks ascribed to metallic Pt (similar to 30-46 nm) were clearly visible on the XRD patterns taken from all the other supported samples. H(2)-TPR analysis of RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) showed reduction peaks ascribed to Rh(i)O(x) species as well as a minor hydrogen spillover effect on the support to be present at T=120 degrees C and 450 degrees C, respectively. Also, the hydrogen consumption of the Rh(i)O(x) species was the highest compared to the other supported RhPt samples. TEM analysis performed on fresh RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) showed that the Rh(i)O(x) and Pt particles were highly dispersed on the support, both with particle sizes in the vicinity of similar to 5-15 nm. Rh species was found on ceria and zirconia, while Pt was present mainly on the ceria layer possibly in the form of Pt-O-Ce bonds. H(2)-chemisorption analysis measured at T similar to 40 degrees C shows similar Rh dispersion results.</p><p>To summarize, the higher activity results of RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) for AIR of diesel, compared to other supported catalysts, may be ascribed to the higher reducibility of Rh(i)O(x) species as well as the superior Rh and Pt dispersion.

These algorithms protect against different failure scenarios (i.e. single link or node failures) and are implemented with different optimization objectives (i.e., minimization of wavelength usage and path length). Results obtained through simulations and comparison with baseline architectures indicate that exploiting dual-homed architecture in the access segment can bring significant improvements in terms of core network resource usage, connection availability, and power consumption.']\n",

Together with the fitted phase plate the optics shows diffraction-limited performance, generating a nearly Gaussian beam profile with a Strehl ratio above 0.8.

      "['Pure and europium (Eu(3+)) doped cerium dioxide (CeO(2)) nanocrystals have been synthesized by a novel oil-in-water microemulsion reaction method under soft conditions. In-situ X-ray diffraction and RAMAN spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV/Vis diffuse-reflectance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as well as time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the nanaocrystals. The as-synthesized powders are nanocrystalline and have a narrow size distribution centered on 3 nm and high surface area of similar to 250 m(2) g(-1). Only a small fraction of the europium ions substitutes for the bulk, cubic Ce(4+) sites in the europium-doped ceria nanocrystals. Upon calcination up to 1000 degrees C, a remarkable high surface area of similar to 120 m(2) g (-1) is preserved whereas an enrichment of the surface Ce(4+) relative to Ce(3+) ions and relative strong europium emission with a lifetime of similar to 1.8 ms and FWHM as narrow as 10 cm(-1) are measured. Under excitation into the UV and visible spectral range, the europium doped ceria nanocrystals display a variable emission spanning the orange-red wavelengths. The tunable emission is explained by the heterogeneous distribution of the europium dopants within the ceria nanocrystals coupled with the progressive diffusion of the europium ions from the surface to the inner ceria sites and the selective participation of the ceria host to the emission sensitization. Effects of the bulk-doping and impregnation with europium on the ceria host structure and optical properties are also discussed.']\n",

Symmetric static models of the human larynx with a divergent glottis are considered, with the presence of false vocal folds (FVFs). The compressible study agrees well with that of the incompressible study. Due to the high enough Reynolds number, the flow is unsteady and develops asymmetric states downstream of the glottis. The glottal jet curvature decreases with the presence of FVFs or the ventricular folds. The gap between the FVFs stretches the flow structure and reduces the jet curvature. The presence of FVFs has a significant effect on the laryngeal flow resistance. The intra-glottal vortex structures are formed on the divergent wall of the glottis, immediately downstream of the separation point. The vortices are then convected downstream and characterized by a significant negative static pressure. The FVFs are a main factor in the generation of stronger vortices, and thus on the closure of the TVFs. The direct link between the FVFs geometry and the motion of the TVFs, and by extension to the voice production, is of interest for medical applications as well as future research works.

At the exit of a pipe nozzle of diameter D, the jet is characterized by a nozzle pressure ratio of 4.03, an exit Mach number of 1, a fully expanded Mach number of 1.56, and a Reynolds number of 6 x 10(4). Four distances between the nozzle and the plate of 2.08D, 2.80D, 3.65D, and 4.66D are considered. Snapshots of vorticity, density, pressure, and mean velocity flowfields are first presented. The latter results compare well with data of the literature. In three cases, in particular, a Mach disk appears to form just upstream from the plate. The convection velocity of flow structures between the nozzle and the plate, and its dependence on the nozzle-to-plate distance, are then examined. The properties of the jet near pressure fields are subsequently described using Fourier analysis. Tones emerge in the spectra at frequencies consistent with those expected for an aeroacoustic feedback loop between the nozzle and the plate as well as with measurements. Their amplitudes are particularly high in the presence of a near-wall Mach disk. The axisymmetric or helical natures of the jet oscillations at the tone frequencies are determined. The motions of the Mach disk found just upstream from the plate for certain nozzle-to-plate distances are then explored. As noted for the jet oscillations, axially pulsing and helical motions are observed, in agreement with experiments. Finally, the intermittency of the tone intensities is studied.

At the exit of a straight pipe nozzle of radius r(0), the jet is ideally expanded, and has a Mach number of 1.5 and a Reynolds number of 6 x 10(4). Four distances between the nozzle exit and the flat plate, equal to 6r(0), 8r(0), 10r(0) and 12r(0), have been considered. In this way, the variations of the convection velocity of the shear-layer turbulent structures according to the nozzle-to-plate distance are shown. In the spectra obtained inside and outside of the flow near the nozzle, several tones emerge at Strouhal numbers in agreement with measurements in the literature. At these frequencies, by applying Fourier decomposition to the pressure fields, hydrodynamic-acoustic standing waves containing a whole number of cells between the nozzle and the plate and axisymmetric or helical jet oscillations are found. The tone frequencies and the mode numbers inferred from the standing-wave patterns are in line with the classical feedback-loop model, in which the loop is closed by acoustic waves outside the jet. The axisymmetric or helical nature of the jet oscillations at the tone frequencies is also consistent with a wave analysis using a jet vortex-sheet model, providing the allowable frequency ranges for the upstream-propagating acoustic wave modes of the jet. In particular, the tones are located on the part of the dispersion relations of the modes where these waves have phase and group velocities close to the ambient speed of sound. Based on the observation of the pressure fields and on frequency-wavenumber spectra on the jet axis and in the shear layers, such waves are identified inside the present jets, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, for a supersonic jet flow. This study thus suggests that the feedback loop in ideally expanded impinging jets is completed by these waves.']\n",

Four jets are underexpanded and four jets are ideally expanded, which allowed examination of the influence of the presence of shock-cell structures. The underexpanded jets are characterized by a fully expanded Mach number of 1.56 and an exit Mach number of 1. The ideally expanded jets have a Mach number of 1.5. The Reynolds number of the eight jets is equal to 6x104. The jets impinge normally on a flat plate located from 4.16r0 to 12r0 downstream of the nozzle and generate acoustic tones due to an aeroacoustic feedback mechanism. In this paper, the near pressure and density fields of the jets are characterized using Fourier transform on the nozzle exit plane, the plate, and an azimuthal plane. First, mean and rms radial velocities of the wall jets are examined. The impact of the shock-cell structure on the wall jet is discussed. The pressure spectra on the plate are then shown as a function of the radial coordinate. The tone frequencies are all visible where the jet shear layers impinge the plate, but only some of them emerge in the wall jet created after the impact. For the ideally expanded jets, the temporal organization of the wall jet along the frequencies of the feedback mechanism decreases with the nozzle-to-plate distance, but for the nonideally expanded jets, this organization is linked to the oscillation of the Mach disk located just upstream of the plate. Consecutively, the amplitude and the phase fields at the tone frequencies are represented on the three planes mentioned earlier. Similar spatial organizations of the turbulent structures are found in the jet shear layers and in the wall jets. Thus, axisymmetric and helical arrangements of the structures in the jet shear layers lead to concentric and spiral distributions of the structures on the plate, respectively. In particular, for one of the underexpanded jets, a spiral shape and concentric rings, associated with two tone frequencies generated simultaneously, are observed on the flat plate in the pressure and density phase fields. Finally, the convection velocity of the turbulent structures at the tone frequencies in the wall jets are evaluated based on phase fields, and the mean convection velocity is computed using cross correlations of radial velocity. The results are in good agreement with those from a recent experimental study of ideally expanded impinging jets.']\n",

The main aim of the present study is to elucidate the influence of the non-equilibrium microstructure obtained by SLM on corrosion susceptibility and extent of metal release (measure of biocompatibility). Methods. A multi-analytical approach has been employed by combining microscopic and bulk compositional tools with electrochemical techniques and chemical analyses of metals in biologically relevant fluids for three differently SLM fabricated CoCrMo alloys and one cast CoCrMo alloy used for comparison. Results. Rapid cooling and strong temperature gradients during laser melting resulted in the formation of a fine cellular structure with cell boundaries enriched in Mo (Co depleted), and suppression of carbide precipitation and formation of a martensitic epsilon (hcp) phase at the surface. These features were shown to decrease the corrosion and metal release susceptibility of the SLM alloys compared with the cast alloy. Unique textures formed in the pattern of the melting pools of the three different laser melted CoCrMo alloys predominantly explain observed small, though significant, differences. The susceptibility for corrosion and metal release increased with an increased number (area) of laser melt pool boundaries. Significance. This study shows that integrative and interdisciplinary studies of microstructural characteristics, corrosion, and metal release are essential to assess and consider during the design and fabrication of CoCrMo dental components of optimal biocompatibility. The reason is that the extent of metal release from CoCrMo is dependent on fabrication procedures.']\n",

Asphalt concrete layers were considered as linear elastic where stress-dependent behaviour of unbound materials was considered when computing responses for the M-E permanent deformation models with a nonlinear elastic response model. Traffic wandering was also accounted for in modelling the traffic by assuming it was normally distributed and a time-hardening approach was applied to add together the permanent deformation contributions from different stress levels.

The experimental results showed that the MEA loss per ton captured CO2 increased with the addition of SO2, resulting in sharp decreases in CO2 removal efficiency and mass transfer rate of CO2 after initial several days of operation. This tendency is mainly attributed to the promotional effect of SO2 on the degradation of MEA by the formation of sulfate. Thus, it is necessary to regenerate MEA using a reclaimer in this case. The respective SO2 concentrations at the outlets of absorber and stripper remained constant values of 24 and 120ppb throughout the operation although the CO2 removal efficiency decreased dramatically with time. This co-capture of CO2 and SO2 could play an important role in further desulfuration, thus alleviating the burden of desulfuration to some extent and benefiting the subsequent CO2 purification and storage.

Hence, a lossy, bulky, and costly filter inductor is avoided and the resulting output dv/dt is limited to 5-10 kV/mu s independent of the output current and switching speed of the SiC devices. As a consequence, loads with dv/dt constraints, e.g., motor drives can be fed from SiC devices enabling full utilization of their high switching speed.

Finally, results are shown using a 300-A 1700-V SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET).

Hence, the total switching losses, including the filter losses, are verified to be three times lower compared to when the MOSFET dv/dt was slowed down by adjusting the gate driver.']\n",

      "['This study investigates the possibility of capturing CO<sub>2</sub> from flue gas under pressurised conditions, which could prove to be beneficial in comparison to working under atmospheric conditions. Simulations of two hybrid combined cycles with pressurised fluidised bed combustion and CO<sub>2</sub> capture are presented. CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from pressurised flue gas by means of chemical absorption after the boiler but before expansion. The results show a CO<sub>2</sub> capture penalty of approximately 8 percentage points (including 90% CO<sub>2</sub> capture rate and compression to 110 bar), which makes the efficiency for the best performing cycle 43.9%. It is 5.2 percentage points higher than the most probable alternative, i.e. using a natural gas fired combined cycle and a pulverised coal fired condensing plant separately with the same fuel split ratio. The largest part of the penalty is associated with the lower mass flow of flue gas after CO<sub>2</sub> capture, which leads to a decrease in work output in the expander and potential for feed water heating. The penalty caused by the regeneration of absorbent is quite low, since the high pressure permits the use of potassium carbonate, which requires less regeneration heat than for example the more commonly proposed monoethanolamine. Although the efficiencies of the cycles look promising it will be important to perform a cost estimate to be able to make a fair comparison with other systems. Such a cost estimate has not been done in this study. A significant drawback of these hybrid cycles in that respect is the complex nature of the systems that will have a negative effect on the economy.']\n",

However, it is sometimes overlooked for CT applications because of its low absorption efficiency and high fraction of Compton scatter. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that silicon is a feasible material for CT detectors by showing energy-resolved CT images acquired with an 80 kVp x-ray tube spectrum using a photon-counting silicon-strip detector with eight energy thresholds developed in our group.

The phantom consists of a plastic cylinder with circular inserts containing water, fat and aqueous solutions of calcium, iodine and gadolinium, in different concentrations. By using basis material decomposition we obtain water, calcium, iodine and gadolinium basis images and demonstrate that these basis images can be used to separate the different materials in the inserts.

First, a miniaturized and parallelized assay system employing antigen suspension bead array technology was used to screen 97 bovine sera for their humoral immune response towards 61 recombinant surface proteins from M. mycoides SC. Statistical analysis of the data resulted in selection of eight proteins that showed strong serologic responses in CBPP-affected sera and minimal reactivity in negative control sera, with p-values less than 10-6. Only minor cross reactivity to hyperimmune sera against other mycoplasmas was observed. When applied in an ELISA, the cocktail of eight recombinant antigens allowed a five fold signal separation between 24 CBPP-affected and 23 CBPP-free sera from different geographical origin. No false positives and only two false negatives were obtained. In conclusion, the selected recombinant mycoplasma antigens qualified as highly specific markers for CBPP and could be employed in both a suspension bead array platform and a cocktail ELISA setting.

Extracellular loops in OMPs of Gram-negative bacteria are known to be highly variable. We examined the sequence diversity of Î²-barrel-encoding regions of tprC, tprD, and bamA in 31 specimens from Cali, Colombia; San Francisco, California; and the Czech Republic and compared them to allelic variants in the 41 reference genomes in the NCBI database. To establish a phylogenetic framework, we used T. pallidum 0548 (tp0548) genotyping and tp0558 sequences to assign strains to the Nichols or SS14 clades. We found that (i) Î²-barrels in clinical strains could be grouped according to allelic variants in T. pallidum subsp. pallidum reference genomes; (ii) for all three OMP loci, clinical strains within the Nichols or SS14 clades often harbored Î²-barrel variants that differed from the Nichols and SS14 reference strains; and (iii) OMP variable regions often reside in predicted extracellular loops containing B-cell epitopes. On the basis of structural models, nonconservative amino acid substitutions in predicted transmembrane Î²-strands of T. pallidum repeat C (TprC) and TprD2 could give rise to functional differences in their porin channels. OMP profiles of some clinical strains were mosaics of different reference strains and did not correlate with results from enhanced molecular typing.

They also set the stage for topology-based analysis of antibody responses to OMPs and help frame strategies for syphilis vaccine development. IMPORTANCE Despite recent progress characterizing outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Treponema pallidum, little is known about how their surface-exposed, Î²-barrel-forming domains vary among strains circulating within high-risk populations. In this study, sequences for the Î²-barrel-encoding regions of three OMP loci, tprC, tprD, and bamA, in T. pallidum subsp. pallidum isolates from a large number of patient specimens from geographically disparate sites were examined. Structural models predict that sequence variation within Î²-barrel domains occurs predominantly within predicted extracellular loops. Amino acid substitutions in predicted transmembrane strands that could potentially affect porin channel function were also noted. Our findings suggest that selection pressures exerted within human populations drive T. pallidum subsp. pallidum OMP diversity and that recombination at OMP loci contributes to the evolutionary biology of syphilis spirochetes. These results also set the stage for topology-based analysis of antibody responses that promote clearance of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum and frame strategies for vaccine development based upon conserved OMP extracellular loops.']\n",

A thorough review on common measurement techniques as well as correction methods reveals, that there are a number of pitfalls, that-when not accounted for-can lead to wrong conclusions about the wall position and thereby also on the near-wall behaviour of mean and turbulence quantities. Employing the state-of-the-art databases from direct numerical simulations of wall-bounded turbulent flows various indirect methods have been tested and assessed in terms of their robustness and accuracy. It is also demonstrated that accurate measurements reaching the viscous sublayer are necessary in order to ensure a correctly deduced wall position, and dependent quantities as for instance the near-wall scaling of mean (e.g. Reynolds number dependence of the buffer region or the log law constants) and turbulence (e.g. the near-wall peak location of Reynolds stresses) quantities. In experiments using hot-wires near the wall it is well known that heat conduction between the hot-wire and the wall gives errors and mean velocity data from the viscous sublayer can usually not be used to determine the wall position. In this paper we introduce a new method which takes advantage of the similarity of the probability density distributions (pdf) in the near wall region. By using the high velocity data of the pdf, which is shown not to be affected by heat conduction, the heat conduction problem can be circumvented. Extensive appendices are included, describing the history and present knowledge about the scaling of the mean velocity in the near wall and overlap regions in wall bounded turbulent flows.']\n",

For the near-wall peak, recent results seem to have clarified the controversy; however, one of the remaining issues in this respect is the emergence of a second (so-called outer) peak at high Reynolds numbers. The present letter introduces a new scaling of the local turbulence intensity profile, based on the diagnostic plot by Alfredsson and Orlu [Eur. J. Mech. B/Fluids 42, 403 (2010)], which predicts the location and amplitude of the \"outer\" peak and suggests its presence as a question of sufficiently large scale separation.']\n",

      "['In experiments using hot wires near the wall, it is well known that wall interference effects between the hot wire and the wall give rise to errors, and mean velocity data from the viscous sublayer can usually not be used to determine the wall position, nor the friction velocity from the linear velocity distribution. Here, we introduce a new method that takes advantage of the similarity of the probability density distributions (PDF) or rather the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) in the near-wall region. By using the velocity data in the CDF in a novel way, it is possible to circumvent the problem associated with heat transfer to the wall and to accurately determine both the wall position and the friction velocity. Prior to its exploitation, the self-similarity of the distribution functions of the streamwise velocity fluctuations within the viscous sublayer is established, and it is shown that they can accurately be described by a lognormal distribution.']\n",

      "['The distribution of the streamwise velocity turbulence intensity has recently been discussed in several papers both from the viewpoint of new experimental results as well as attempts to model its behavior.

Fluids 23 (2011) 041702] observed that in the outer region of the boundary layer a universal linear decay of the turbulence intensity independent of the Reynolds number exists. This approach has been generalized for channel and pipe flows as well, and it has been found that the deviation from the previously established linear region appears at a given wall distance in viscous units (around 120) for all three canonical flows. Based on these results, new empirical fits for the streamwise velocity turbulence intensity distribution of each canonical flow are proposed. Coupled with a mean streamwise velocity profile description the model provides a composite profile for the streamwise variance profile that agrees nicely with existing numerical and experimental data. Extrapolation of the proposed scaling to high Reynolds numbers predicts the emergence of a second peak of the streamwise variance profile that at even higher Reynolds numbers overtakes the inner one.']\n",

      "['An analysis of velocity statistics and spectra measured above a wind-tunnel forest model is reported. Several measurement stations downstream of the forest edge have been investigated and it is observed that, while the mean velocity profile adjusts quickly to the new canopy boundary condition, the turbulence lags behind and shows a continuous penetration towards the free stream along the canopy model. The statistical profiles illustrate this growth and do not collapse when plotted as a function of the vertical coordinate. However, when the statistics are plotted as function of the local mean velocity (normalized with a characteristic velocity scale), they do collapse, independently of the streamwise position and freestream velocity. A new scaling for the spectra of all three velocity components is proposed based on the velocity variance and integral time scale. This normalization improves the collapse of the spectra compared to existing scalings adopted in atmospheric measurements, and allows the determination of a universal function that provides the velocity spectrum. Furthermore, a comparison of the proposed scaling laws for two different canopy densities is shown, demonstrating that the vertical velocity variance is the most sensible statistical quantity to the characteristics of the canopy roughness.']\n",

      "['This paper introduces a new method based on the diagnostic plot (Alfredsson et al., Phys. Fluids, vol. 23, 2011, 041702) to assess the convergence towards a well-behaved zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) turbulent boundary layer (TBL). The most popular and well-understood methods to assess the convergence towards a well-behaved state rely on empirical skin-friction curves (requiring accurate skin-friction measurements), shape-factor curves (requiring full velocity profile measurements with an accurate wall position determination) or wake-parameter curves (requiring both of the previous quantities). On the other hand, the proposed diagnostic-plot method only needs measurements of mean and fluctuating velocities in the outer region of the boundary layer at arbitrary wall-normal positions. To test the method, six tripping configurations, including optimal set-ups as well as both under- and overtripped cases, are used to quantify the convergence of ZPG TBLs towards well-behaved conditions in the Reynolds-number range covered by recent high-fidelity direct numerical simulation data up to a Reynolds number based on the momentum thickness and free-stream velocity of approximately 4000 (corresponding to 2.5 m from the leading edge) in a wind-tunnel experiment. Additionally, recent high-Reynolds-number data sets have been employed to validate the method. The results show that weak tripping configurations lead to deviations in the mean flow and the velocity fluctuations within the logarithmic region with respect to optimally tripped boundary layers. On the other hand, a strong trip leads to a more energized outer region, manifested in the emergence of an outer peak in the velocity-fluctuation profile and in a more prominent wake region. While established criteria based on skin-friction and shape-factor correlations yield generally equivalent results with the diagnostic-plot method in terms of convergence towards a well-behaved state, the proposed method has the advantage of being a practical surrogate that is a more efficient tool when designing the set-up for TBL experiments, since it diagnoses the state of the boundary layer without the need to perform extensive velocity profile measurements.']\n",

Pre-clinical development of such drugs is facilitated if their interaction with FcRn can be studied in vitro. For this reason we have developed a robust system for production of the soluble extracellular domain of human FcRn as well as the full-length receptor as fusion to green fluorescent protein, taking advantage of a lentivirus-based gene delivery system where stable over-expressing cells are easily and rapidly generated. Production of the extracellular domain in multiple-layered culture flasks, followed by affinity purification using immobilized IgG, resulted in capture of milligram amounts of soluble receptor per liter cell culture with retained IgG binding. The receptor was further characterized by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, circular dichroism spectroscopy, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance and a temperature stability assay showing a functional and stable protein of high purity.

Numerical studies show that in the case of using the bi-linear surface negative variance components were come out, the bi-quadratic can model the difference better and delivers errors of 2.7 km and 1.5 km for the gravimetric and seismic models, respectively. These errors are 2.1 km and 1.6 km in the case of using the bi-cubic surface and 1 km and 1.5 km when the multi-quadric radial base function is used.

The number of GNSS/levelling data over Sweden and Norway are much larger than those in Denmark and Finland. This causes that the corrector surfaces are fitted better in these countries and consequently the estimated errors for the geoid become larger than what they should be in the others.

The prevalence for thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) is significantly increased in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) compared with patients who have a normal tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). TAA rupture is a life-threatening event, and biomechanics-based simulations of the aorta may help to disentangle the molecular mechanism behind its development and progression. The present study used polarized microscopy and macroscopic in vitro tensile testing to explore collagen organization and mechanical properties of TAA wall specimens from BAV and TAV patients. Methods. Circumferential sections of aneurysmal aortic tissue from BAV and TAV patients were obtained during elective operations. The distribution of collagen orientation was captured by a Bingham distribution, and finite element models were used to estimate constitutive model parameters from experimental load-displacement curves. Results. Collagen orientation was almost identical in BAV and TAV patients, with a highest probability of alignment along the circumferential direction. The strength was almost two times higher in BAV samples (0.834 MPa) than in TAV samples (0.443 MPa; p &lt; 0.001). The collagen-related stiffness (C-f) was significantly increased in BAV compared with TAV patients (C-f = 7.45 MPa vs 3.40 MPa; p = 0.003), whereas the elastin-related stiffness was similar in both groups. A trend toward a decreased wall thickness was seen in BAV patients (p = 0.058). Conclusions. The aneurysmal aortas of BAV patients show a higher macroscopic strength, mainly due to an increased collagen-related stiffness, compared with TAV patients. The increased wall stiffness in BAV patients may contribute to the higher prevalence for TAAs in this group.']\n",

Method: Porcine common carotid arteries (n = 10) were harvested and used to (i) characterize the collagen fiber organization with polarized light microscopy, and (ii) the biaxial mechanical properties by inflation testing.The collagen organization was quantified by the Bingham orientation density function (ODF), which in turn was integrated in a structural constitutive model of the vessel wall.A one-layered and thick-walled model was used to estimate mechanical constitutive parameters by least-square fitting the recorded in vitro inflation test results.Finally, uniaxial data published elsewhere were used to validate the mean collagen organization described by the Bingham ODF. Results: Thick collagen fibers, i.e.the most mechanically relevant structure, in the common carotid artery are dispersed around the circumferential direction.In addition, almost all samples showed two distinct families of collagen fibers at different elevation, but not azimuthal, angles.Collagen fiber organization could be accurately represented by the Bingham ODF (kappa(1,2,3) = [13.5, 0.0, 25.2] and kappa(1,2,3) = [14.7, 0.0,26.6]; average error of about 5%), and their integration into a structural constitutive model captured the inflation characteristics of individual carotid artery samples.Specifically, only four mechanical parameters were required to reasonably (average error from 14% to 38%) cover the experimental data over a wide range of axial and circumferential stretches.However, it was critical to account for fibrilar links between thick collagen fibers.Finally, the mean Bingham ODF provide also good approximation to uniaxial experimental data. Conclusions: The applied structural constitutive model, based on individually measured collagen orientation densities, was able to capture the biaxial properties of the common carotid artery. Since the model required coupling amongst thick collagen fibers, the collagen fiber orientations measured from polarized light microscopy, alone, seem to be insufficient structural information. Alternatively, a larger dispersion of collagen fiber orientations, that is likely to arise from analyzing larger wall sections, could have had a similar effect, i.e. could have avoided coupling amongst thick collagen fibers. Statement of Significance The applied structural constitutive model, based on individually measured collagen orientation densities, was able to capture the biaxial and uniaxial properties of the common carotid artery. Since the model required coupling amongst thick collagen fibers, an effective orientation density that accounts for cross links between the main collagen fibers has been porposed. The model provides a good approximation to the experimental data.\"]\n",

      "['Apart from the most common H-1 and O-16 we have the sister isotopes: deuterium D and O-18 in water. Isotope fractionation (the change in its concentration) occurs in any thermodynamic reaction. The isotopic composition serves as a distinct mark for each water sample. To carry out the isotope analysis of pore water, which may be used to reveal the source of excessive water in building elements, firstly one has to extrude water from voids. For this we tested three different methods of retrieving water from the porous material: squeezing and evaporation - the direct methods, dilution - the indirect method. The influence of capillary suction on the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes abundance ratio was also analysed. Materials whose substantial part of voids are gel pores (cementitious materials) act as a membrane during isotope transport separating lighter from heavier isotopes and therefore cause the fractionation of isotopes. The results of performed experiments indicate that moisture transport (capillary suction) has an influence on the isotopic composition of water. Therefore the isotope analysis can be useful in the investigation of moisture behaviour of porous building materials.']\n",

      "[\"Context. GRB061122 is one of the brightest GRBs detected within INTEGRAL's field of view to date, with a peak flux (20-200 keV) of 32 photons cm(-2) s(-1) and fluence of 2 x 10(-5) erg cm(-2). The Spectrometer aboard INTEGRAL, SPI, can measure linear polarisation in bright GRBs through the process of Compton scattering in the Germanium detectors. Polarisation measurements of the prompt emission are relatively rare. The spectral and polarisation results can be combined to provide vital information about the circumburst region. Aims. The two gamma-ray detectors on INTEGRAL were used to investigate the spectral characteristics of GRB061122. A search for linear polarisation in the prompt emission was carried out on GRB061122 using the SPI multiple event data in the energy range 100 keV-1 MeV. The X-ray properties were examined using data from the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on Swift. Methods. The gamma-ray spectral and temporal properties of GRB061122 were determined using IBIS and SPI. The afterglow properties were obtained using XRT. The multiple event data of GRB061122 from SPI were analysed and compared with the predicted instrument response obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations using the GEANT 4 INTEGRAL mass model. The chi(2) distributions between the real and simulated data as a function of the percentage polarisation and polarisation angle were calculated and limits on the level and angle of polarisation were obtained from the best-fit value of chi(2). Results. The prompt spectrum was best fit by a combination of a blackbody and a power-law model (the quasithermal model), with evidence for high energy emission continuing above 8 MeV. A pseudo-redshift value of pz = 0.95 +/- 0.18 was determined using the spectral fit parameters. The isotropic energy at this pseudo-redshift is 8.5 x 10(52) erg. The jet opening angle was estimated to be smaller than 2.8 degrees or larger than 11.9 degrees from the X-ray lightcurve. An upper limit of 60% polarisation was determined for the prompt emission of GRB061122, using the multiple event data from the spectrometer on INTEGRAL. Conclusions. The high energy emission observed in the spectrum may be due to the reverse shock interacting with the GRB ejecta when it is decelerated by the circumburst medium. This behaviour has been observed in a small fraction of GRBs to date, but is expected to be more commonly observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The conditions for polarisation are met if the jet opening angle is less than 2.8 degrees, but further constraints on the level of polarisation are not possible.\"]\n",

      "[\"Flavoenzymes perform a wide range of redox reactions in nature, and a subclass of flavoenzymes carry covalently bound cofactor. The enzyme-flavin bond helps to increase the flavin's redox potential to facilitate substrate oxidation in several oxidases. The formation of the enzyme-flavin covalent bond-the flavinylation reaction-has been studied for the past 40 years. For the most advocated mechanism of autocatalytic flavinylation, the quinone methide mechanism, appropriate stabilization of developing negative charges at the flavin N(1) and N(5) loci is crucial. Whereas the structural basis for stabilization at N(1) is relatively well studied, the structural requisites for charge stabilization at N(5) remain less clear. Here, we show that flavinylation of histidine 167 of pyranose 2-oxidase from Trametes multicolor requires hydrogen bonding at the flavin N(5)/O(4) locus, which is offered by the side chain of Thr169 when the enzyme is in its closed, but not open, state. Moreover, our data show that additional stabilization at N(5) by histidine 548 is required to ensure high occupancy of the histidyl flavin bond. The combination of structural and spectral data on pyranose 2-oxidase mutants supports the quinone methide mechanism. Our results demonstrate an elaborate structural fine-tuning of the active site to complete its own formation that couples efficient holoenzyme synthesis to conformational substates of the substrate-recognition loop and concerted movements of side chains near the flavinylation ligand.

However, the geomagnetic cutoff in the cosmic ray electron-plus-positron (CRE) spectrum in low Earth orbit does provide such a spectral feature. The energy and spectral shape of this cutoff can be calculated with the aid of a numerical code tracing charged particles in the Earth's magnetic field.

The present study provides the first collective discussion on extent and controls of elevated As in deeper groundwater of a regional study area in the western part of the Bengal basin. Deeper groundwater is defined here as non-brackish, potable (Cl- &lt;= 250 mg/L) groundwater available at the maximum accessed depth (similar to 80-300 m). The extent of elevated As in deeper groundwater in the study area seems to be largely controlled by the aquifer-aquitard framework. Arsenic-enriched deeper groundwater is mostly encountered north of 22.75 degrees N latitude, where an unconfined to semi-confined aquifer consisting of Holocene- to early Neogene-age gray sand dominates the hydrostratigraphy to 300 m depth below land surface. Aquifer sediments are not abnormally enriched in As at any depth, but sediment and water chemistry are conducive to As mobilization in both shallow and deeper parts of the aquifer(s). The biogeochemical triggers are influenced by complex redox disequilibria. Results of numerical modeling and profiles of environmental tracers at a local-scale study site suggest that deeper groundwater abstraction can draw As-enriched water to 150 m depth within a few decades, synchronous with the advent of wide-scale irrigational pumping in West Bengal (India).']\n",

These trends are attributed to a vertically shift of the hydrochemically stratified water column at the beginning of the monsoon season. This naturally occurring effect can be additionally superimposed by groundwater extraction, as demonstrated on a local scale by an in situ experiment simulating extensive groundwater withdrawal during the dry post-monsoon season. Results of this experiment suggest that groundwater extraction promoted an enduring change within the distribution of dissolved As in the local aquifer. Presented outcomes contribute to the discussion of anthropogenic pumping influences that endanger the limited and yet arsenic-free groundwater resources of the BDP.']\n",

This study deals with groundwater hydrochemistry vis-a-vis As exposure assessment among rural population in Chakdaha block, West Bengal, India. The water quality survey reveals that 96% of the tubewells exceed WHO guideline value (10 mu g/L of As). The groundwaters are generally anoxic (-283 to -22 mV) with circum-neutral pH (6.3 to 7.8). The hydrochemistry is dominated by HCO3- (208 to 440 mg/L), Ca2+ (79 to 178 mg/L) and Mg2+ (17 to 45 mg/L) ions along with high concentrations of As-T (As total, below detection limit to 0.29 mg/L), Fe-T (Fe total, 1.2 to 16 mg/L), and Fe(II) (0.74 to 16 mg/L). The result demonstrates that Fe(II)-Fe(III) cycling is the dominant process for the release of As from aquifer sediments to groundwater (and vice versa), which is mainly controlled by the local biogeochemical conditions. The exposure scenario reveals that the consumption of groundwater and rice are the major pathways of As accumulation in human body, which is explained by the dietary habit of the surveyed population.

The study examines the effects of heterogeneity and assortativity of customer revenue on the profit impact of negative word-of-mouth that is initiated by three groups of consumers-revenue leaders, social hubs, and experts. The authors explore these effects using an agent-based simulation modeling approach and an in-depth computational experiment with empirical input data regarding social connectivity from 10 consumer social networks. The results indicate that negative word-of-mouth is more damaging in markets where there is a higher degree of heterogeneity. Moreover, assortativity may significantly affect the profit impact of disappointments, but this effect depends on the initial percentage of disappointed adopters. The study also finds an interaction between heterogeneity and assortativity, such that the effect of heterogeneity increases as assortativity increases up to a moderate level of assortativity, then the effect of heterogeneity on profits remains relatively constant. The implications from these results suggest that marketing managers should consider the heterogeneity and assortativity characteristics of their customer revenue streams to (a) better manage the adverse profit impacts of customer disappointments and negative word-of-mouth; (b) design more effective customer loyalty programs; and (c) more efficiently manage their customer equity portfolios.']\n",

This formulation is independent of the spatial representation of the functions, which allows us to employ a dynamic representation with an accuracy of about the level of machine precision at each iteration similar to what is done in the Chebfun system with its chebop functionality although our function representation is entirely based on coefficients instead of function values. Our approach also allows nonlinearity in the boundary conditions of the PDE. The algorithm is illustrated with several examples, e.g., the study of eigenvalues of a vibrating string with delayed boundary feedback control.']\n",

      "[\"We study the problem of plan synthesis for multi-agent systems, to achieve complex, high-level, long-term goals that are assigned to each agent individually. As the agents might not be capable of satisfying their respective goals by themselves, requests for other agents' collaborations are a part of the task descriptions. We consider that each agent is modeled as a discrete state-transition system and its task specification takes a form of a linear temporal logic formula. A traditional automata-based approach to multi-agent plan synthesis from such specifications builds on centralized team planning and full team synchronization after each agents' discrete step, and thus suffers from extreme computational demands. We aim at reducing the computational complexity by decomposing the plan synthesis problem into finite horizon planning problems that are solved iteratively, upon the run of the agents. We introduce an event-based synchronization that allows our approach to efficiently adapt to different time durations of different agents' discrete steps. We discuss the correctness of the solution and find assumptions, under which the proposed iterative algorithm leads to provable eventual satisfaction of the desired specifications.\"]\n",

Similar to many preconditioned iterative methods for discretized PDEs, this approach requires the construction of an accurate and efficient preconditioner. For the waveguide eigenvalue problem, the associated linear system can be formulated as a generalized Sylvester equation AX+XB+A1XB1+A2XB2+K(ring operator)X=C, where (ring operator) denotes the Hadamard product. The equation is approximated by a low-rank correction of a Sylvester equation, which we use as a preconditioner. The action of the preconditioner is efficiently computed by using the matrix equation version of the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) formula. We show how the preconditioner can be integrated into Resinv. The results are illustrated by applying the method to large-scale problems.']\n",

      "[\"Background: The predictions of stress fields in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) depend on constitutive descriptions of the aneurysm wall and the Intra-luminal Thrombus (ILT). ILT is a porous diluted structure (biphasic solid-fluid material) and its impact on AAA biomechanics is controversially discussed in the literature. Specifically, pressure measurements showed that the ILT cannot protect the wall from the arterial pressure, while other (numerical and experimental) studies showed that at the same time it reduces the stress in the wall. Method: To explore this phenomenon further a poroelastic description of the ILT was integrated in Finite Element (FE) Models of the AAA. The AAA model was loaded by a pressure step and a cyclic pressure wave and their transition into wall tension was investigated. To this end ILT's permeability was varied within a microstructurally motivated range. Results: The two-phase model verified that the ILT transmits the entire mean arterial pressure to the wall while, at the same time, it significantly reduces the stress in the wall. The predicted mean stress in the AAA wall was insensitive to the permeability of the ILT and coincided with the results of AAA models using a single-phase ILT description. Conclusion: At steady state, the biphasic ILT behaves like a single-phase material in an AAA model. Consequently, computational efficient FE single-phase models, as they have been exclusively used in the past, accurately predict the wall stress in AAA models.\"]\n",

Absorptivities are found to be affected by residual Fabry-Perot interference arising from measurements of reflection and transmission at locations of different film thickness. Multiple computational and experimental methods to avoid these errors in thin film measurements, in general, are discussed. Corrected absorptivity depends on the quantity of Si embedded in the SiC but is independent of the Si crystallinity, indicating a relaxation of the k-conservation criterion for optical transitions in the nanocrystals. Tauc gaps of 1.8-2.0 and 2.12 eV are determined for Si nanoclusters and SiC, respectively. PL spectra exhibit a red-shift of similar to 100 nm per nm nominal Si nanocluster diameter, which is in agreement with quantum confinement but revealed to be an artifact entirely due to Fabry-Perot interference. Several simple experimental methods to diagnose or avoid interference in PL measurements are developed that are applicable to all thin films. Corrected PL is rather weak and invariant with passivation, indicating that non-paramagnetic defects are responsible for rapid non-radiative recombination. They are also responsible for the broad, sub-gap PL of the SiC, and can wholly account for the form of the PL of samples with Si nanoclusters. The PL intensity of samples with Si nanoclusters, however, can only be explained with an increased density of luminescent defects in the SiC due to Si nanoclusters, efficient tunneling of photogenerated carriers from Si nanoclusters to SiC defects, or with emission from a-Si nanoclusters. Films prepared on Si exhibit much weaker PL than the same films prepared on quartz substrates.']\n",

For obvious reasons, commercial codes are lagging behind academic codes often dedicated either to the implementation of one new technique, or the upscaling of current conventional codes to tackle massively large scale computational problems. Only in a few cases, both approaches have been followed simultaneously. In this article, a solid mechanics simulation strategy for parallel supercomputers based on a hybrid approach is presented. Hybrid parallelization exploits the thread-level parallelism of multicore architectures, combining MPI tasks with OpenMP threads. This paper describes the proposed strategy, programmed in Alya, a parallel multi-physics code. Hybrid parallelization is specially well suited for the current trend of supercomputers, namely large clusters of multicores. The strategy is assessed through transient non-linear solid mechanics problems, both for explicit and implicit schemes, running on thousands of cores. In order to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed strategy under advance algorithmic evolution of computational mechanics, a non-local parallel overset meshes method (Chimera-like) is implemented and the conservation of the scalability is demonstrated.']\n",

The results show that the absence/presence of a characteristic frequency (range) on the power spectrum can indicate the lack/existence of the corresponding periodical structural pattern(s) in the original PMB image.

The 2D-FFT method is thus valid for differentiating various PMB microstructures.

We find that the C-Cl bond length is shorter in HAD when compared to solution phase value, whereas the net atomic charges and dipole moment are significantly larger than the solution phase values. In contradiction to the usual trend that molecules in the vicinity of the proteins are less polar, we report the observation that the protein environment indeed polarizes the DCE solute more than the water solvent. Furthermore, within the protein environment we do not observe any conformational transition between gauche and trans conformers, and the DCE remains in the more polar gauche conformer during the entire simulation time scale. However, the trans conformer interconverts to the gauche conformer spontaneously within 0.4 ps, which clearly indicates that the trans conformer is unstable within the HAD protein. In contrast, the scatter diagram of total Kohn-Sham energy and dihedral angle between Cl-C-C-Cl atoms shows that the gauche and trans conformers have comparable energies in water. Overall, the present calculations show the within the protein not only the structure of DCE is altered but also that the conformational interconversion dynamics is affected very much.

On the basis of the average bond length values and group charge distributions, we find that the SM molecule remains in a neutral quinonoid form in chloroform (a nonpolar solvent) while it transforms to a charge-separated benzenoid form in water (a polar solvent). Based on a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical response technique, with different MM descriptions for the water environment, absorption spectra were obtained as averages over configurations derived from the CP-QM/MM simulations. We show that for SM in water the solute polarization plays a major role in predictions of the lambda(max) and solvatochromic shift and that once this effect is included the contributions from solvent polarization and intermolecular charge transfer become less important. For SM in chloroform and water solvents, we have also performed absorption spectra calculations using a polarizable continuum model in order to address its relative performance compared to the QM/MM response technique. In the case of SM in water, our study supports the notion that, in order to predict accurate absorption spectra and solvatochromic shifts, it is important to use a discrete description of the solvent when it, as in water, is involved in site-specific interaction with the solute molecule. The technique is thus shown to outperform the more conventional polarizable continuum model in predicting the solvatochromic shift.']\n",

The Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) technique is used for gas phase NR, whereas for NR in water solvent, a hybrid quantum mechanics-molecular dynamics (CPMD-QM/MM) approach has been utilized. For the configurations obtained from CPMD and CPMD-QM/MM, the absorption spectrum has been calculated using the INDO/CIS method as implemented in the ZINDO program. Different solvation shells for NR in water have been defined based on solute-all-atoms and solvent center of mass radial distribution function (g(r(X-O)) rdf). The electronic excitation energies for these solvation shells were calculated in a systematic way to evaluate their individual contributions. In addition, calculations of absorption spectra were performed for NR (excluding solvent molecules) obtained from CPMD-QM/MM calculations to isolate the contribution to the solvatochromic shift just due to solvent-induced geometrical change. Interestingly, this geometrical change in NR itself contributes as much as 50 nm to the solvatochromic shift. The calculated lambda(max) for gas phase is around 488 nm and is comparable to the values reported for NR in nonpolar solvents, whereas the inclusion of solvent molecules in the hydration shell yields a lambda(max) of 565 nm which contributes to almost 77 nm of the solvatochromic shift. The inclusion of solvent molecules up to the fourth solvation shell in the g(r(X-O)) rdf yields lambda(max) of 596 nm which is in good agreement with the experimentally reported value 593 nm. The change in lambda(max) due to inclusion of the fourth solvation shell is only 1 nm, indicating that the spectrum has converged with respect to the solvent effect. Overall, this study suggests that the combined use of CPMD-QM/MM and ZINDO can be successfully used to model and to interpret solvatochromic and thermochromic behavior of NR and other organic dye molecules.']\n",

We report remarkable differences in the molecular structure and charge distribution of MC between the two solvents; the molecular structure of MC remains in neutral form in chloroform while it becomes charge-separated, zwitterionic, in water. The dipole moment of MC in water is about 50% larger than in chloroform, while the value for SP in water is in between, suggesting that the solvent is more influential than the conformation itself in deciding the dipole moment for the merocyanine spiropyran pair. The calculations could reproduce the experimentally reported blue shift in the absorption spectra of MC when going from the nonpolar to the polar solvent, though the actual value of the absorption maximum is overestimated in chloroform solvent. We find that the CP-QM/MM approach is appropriate for structure modeling of solvatochromic and thermochromic molecules as this approach is able to capture the solvent and thermal-induced structural changes within the solute important for an accurate assessment of the properties.']\n",

In particular, the structure modeling has been carried out using a Car-Parrinello hybrid QM/MM molecular dynamics approach, while the excitation energies were computed using time dependent density functional theory. To incorporate the solvent effect either a polarizable continuum model or a semicontinuum description was employed. The molecular dipole moment of CPYC in water is more than two times larger than in benzene solvent. The positive and negative charges tend to accumulate on pyridinium and cyclopentadienylide rings, respectively, with increasing solvent polarity. Significant solvent-induced geometrical changes have been reported in CPYC and this contributes to a significant red shift in spectra. Even though the absorption maxima for CPYC in benzene and water solvents were underestimated, the solvatochromic shift has been reproduced in good agreement with experiments.

The procedure is developed to calculate the saturation concentrations/solubility of CaO in slag using thermodynamic models namely FactSage (TM), Cell Model, and Thermo-Calc (TM). Total amount of dissolved lime is evaluated by integrating solubility values in the rate equation of lime dissolution over time taking into account the effects of physical properties and temperature of slag and particle size of flux additions and validated against industrial data available in literature. Comparison between measured and calculated undissolved lime shows a good agreement between them using any thermodynamic models even though there are some differences in the predictions of saturation concentration of CaO in slag.

Consequently, the saltwater-freshwater mixing zones in coastal or estuarine areas are characterized by limited faunal and floral diversity. Although changes in diversity and decline in species richness in brackish waters is well documented in aquatic ecology, it is unknown to what extent this applies to bacterial communities. Here, we report a first detailed bacterial inventory from vertical profiles of 60 sampling stations distributed along the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea, one of world's largest brackish water environments, generated using 454 pyrosequencing of partial (400 bp) 16S rRNA genes. Within the salinity gradient, bacterial community composition altered at broad and finer-scale phylogenetic levels. Analogous to faunal communities within brackish conditions, we identified a bacterial brackish water community comprising a diverse combination of freshwater and marine groups, along with populations unique to this environment. As water residence times in the Baltic Sea exceed 3 years, the observed bacterial community cannot be the result of mixing of fresh water and saltwater, but our study represents the first detailed description of an autochthonous brackish microbiome. In contrast to the decline in the diversity of multicellular organisms, reduced bacterial diversity at brackish conditions could not be established.

Geochemical studies of shallow alluvial aquifer in the Meghna flood plain show that the uppermost yellowish grey sediment is low in As (1.03 mg/kg) compared to the lower dark grey to black sediment (5.24 mg/kg) rich in mica and organic matter. Sequential extraction data show that solid phase As bound to poorly crystalline and amorphous metal (Fe, Mn, Al)-oxyhydroxides is dominant in the grey to dark grey sediment and reaches its maximum level (3.05 mg/kg) in the mica rich layers. Amount of As bound to sulphides and organic matter also peaks in the dark grey to black sediment. Vertical distributions of major elements determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) show that iron (Fe2O3), aluminum (Al2O3) and manganese (MnO) follow the general trend of distribution of As in the sediments. Concentrations of As, Mn, Fe, HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-) and NO3 (-) in groundwater reflect the redox status of the aquifer and are consistent with solid phase geochemistry. Mineralogical analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fitted with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) revealed dominance of crystalline iron oxides and hydroxides like magnetite, hematite and goethite in the oxidised yellowish grey sediment. Amorphous Fe-oxyhydroxides identified as grain coating in the mica and organic matter rich sediment suggests weathering of biotite is playing a critical role as the source of Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides which in turn act as sink for As. Presence of authigenic pyrite in the dark grey sediment indicates active reduction in the aquifer.']\n",

Hence, we combine quantitative transmission electron microscopy and LSKW modelling to investigate the tempering of a martensitic stainless steel 15-5 PH at 500 degrees C. The microstructural characterization shows that the Cu precipitation and growth occur in three stages: i) Cu BCC, n) Cu 9R, and iii) Cu FCC, during tempering up to 1000 h. The modelling predictions of size, volume fraction and number density of precipitates are in good agreement with the experimental results. Thus, the approach with a combination of quantitative electron microscopy and LSKW modelling using CALPHAD-type databases holds promise for further optimization of precipitation-hardening martensitic stainless steels.']\n",

During the first MESSENGER flyby of Mercury, three periodic rotations were observed in the magnetic field data possibly related to a Kelvin-Helmholtz wave on the dusk side magnetopause. We present an analysis of the event, along with comparisons to previous Kelvin-Helmholtz observations and an investigation of what influence finite ion gyro radius effects, believed to be of importance in the Hermean magnetosphere, may have on the instability. The wave signature does not correspond to that of typical Kelvin-Helmholtz events, and the magnetopause direction does not show any signs of major deviation from the unperturbed case. There is thus no indication of any high amplitude surface waves. On the other hand, the wave period corresponds to that expected for a Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, and as the dusk side is shown to be more stable than the dawn side, we judge the observed waves not to be fully developed Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, but they may be an initial perturbation that could cause Kelvin-Helmholtz waves further down the tail.

The quasi-periodic nature of the magnetic field variations during the crossings, the characteristic time separations of similar to 16 s between pairs of crossings, and the variations of the magnetopause normal directions indicate that the signals are likely the signature of surface waves highly steepened at their leading edge that arose from the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.

A particular PON standard sets the framework for the operation of DBA and the limitations it faces. We illustrate these differences between EPON and GPON by means of simulations for the two standards. Moreover, we consider the evolution of both standards to their next-generation counterparts with the bit rate of 10 Gb/s and the implications to the DBA. A new simple GPON DBA algorithm is used to illustrate GPON performance.

This property of the PON can be exploited for node consolidation where multiple central offices are replaced by a single one covering a larger service area. Such node consolidation is being particularly driven by the need for network operational cost saving, and is offering significant challenges to PONs. The degree of node consolidation that can be achieved is limited by the reach of conventional PON systems. In order to achieve a larger degree of node consolidation, an extension of the PON reach, beyond the conventional 20 km, is required. This article addresses the challenges of the dynamic bandwidth allocation, where increased reach results in a degradation of DBA performance and quality of service support. This degradation is a consequence of the increased propagation delay of the DBA messages exchanged between different PON elements. A potential solution to the performance degradation is the introduction of a multi-threaded DBA. In this article, we examine for both Gigabit PON and Ethernet PON, the extent to which DBA performance degradation can be reduced by exploiting multi-threading. It is found that for both standards, multi-threading, if done properly, can be used to mitigate the performance degradation due to the increased reach. To make bandwidth allocation efficient, new schemes for coordinating the multiple threads are required in long reach PON.']\n",

On the other hand, this reach extension necessitates the design of efficient dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes in order to tackle performance degradation caused by the increased propagation delay in long reach PONs. Among many existing approaches, the multi-thread-based DBA scheme where several bandwidth allocation processes are performed in parallel is considered one of the most effective options to improve network performance in LRPONs. We have found that without proper intercommunication between the overlapped threads, multi-thread DBA may lose efficiency and even perform worse than the conventional single-thread algorithm. With this in mind, this article reviews different inter-thread scheduling schemes for LR-PONs, and proposes a novel approach of integrating the key ideas of the existing ones. Extensive simulation results confirm that our proposed scheme can significantly improve DBA performance for LR-PONs under a variety of scenarios with consideration of different values of network load and reach.']\n",

Meanwhile, a passive optical network (PON) is widely recognized as a promising solution for mobile backhaul networks thanks to its high capacity and low energy consumption. In the conventional PON-based mobile backhaul network, where base stations (BSs) are co-located with optical network units, the traffic between the neighboring BSs that are mainly caused by user mobility has to be first sent to the optical line terminal and even further, e.g., edge nodes of mobile core networks, resulting in high latency, although the adjacent BSs are geographically located close to each other. In this paper, a novel PON-based architecture is proposed for mobile backhaul to enhance the connectivity between neighboring BSs. Meanwhile, a tailored medium access control protocol and dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm are introduced to support fast inter-BS communications. The results reveal that a low latency (less than 1 ms packet delay) for communications among any adjacent BSs can be achieved in the proposed PON-based mobile backhaul network, demonstrating great potential to support future time-critical applications.']\n",

Furthermore, the influence of several factors on the occurrence of sagittal trunk inclinations in nurses was investigated. Trunk postures were recorded for nine nursing home nurses from four German nursing homes and 18 hospital nurses from seven hospitals using the CUELA measurement system. A total of 79 shifts, 27 in nursing homes and 52 in hospitals, were analysed. All measurements were supported by video recordings. Specially developed software (WIDAAN 2.75) was used to synchronize the measurement data and video footage. The total duration of inclinations per shift was significantly affected by the working area (nursing home or hospital) with an increase of 25.3 min in nursing homes (95% confidence interval 2.4-48.2; P = 0.032). Another factor was the extent of personal basic care tasks performed by the nurses (P &lt; 0.001). Nursing home nurses worked about twice as long per shift in a forward bending position compared with hospital nurses (112 versus 63 min; P &lt; 0.001) and they assumed almost one-third more inclinations per shift (1541 versus 1170; P = 0.005). Nursing staff perform a large number of inclinations. The amount of time spent by nurses working in a forward bending position was highly dependent on the working area and the extent to which patients were in need of help.

More particularly, the development of both accurate and flexible numerical models able to capture their intrinsically multiscale modes of failure is still a challenge. The standard finite element method typically requires intensive remeshing to adequately capture the geometry of the cracks and high accuracy is thus often sacrificed in favor of scalability, and vice versa. In an effort to preserve both properties, we present here an extended finite element method (XFEM) for large scale composite fracture simulations. In this formulation, the standard FEM formulation is partially enriched by use of shifted Heaviside functions with special attention paid to the scalability of the scheme. This enrichment technique offers several benefits since the interpolation property of the standard shape function still holds at the nodes. Those benefits include (i) no extra boundary condition for the enrichment degree of freedom, and (ii) no need for transition/blending regions; both of which contribute to maintaining the scalability of the code.Two different cohesive zone models (CZM) are then adopted to capture the physics of the crack propagation mechanisms. At the intralaminar level, an extrinsic CZM embedded in the XFEM formulation is used. At the interlaminar level, an intrinsic CZM is adopted for predicting the failure. The overall framework is implemented in ALYA, a mechanics code specifically developed for large scale, massively parallel simulations of coupled multi-physics problems. The implementation of both intrinsic and extrinsic CZM models within the code is such that it conserves the extremely efficient scalability of ALYA while providing accurate physical simulations of computationally expensive phenomena. The strong scalability provided by the proposed implementation is demonstrated. The model is ultimately validated against a full experimental campaign of loading tests and X-ray tomography analyzes.']\n",

This material demonstrated excellent thermal stability, high hole mobility and appropriate energy level alignment with CH3NH3PbI3 and carbon, which make it a potentially excellent alternative interfacial material for PSCs. By interfacial engineering with doped TPDI, the energy barrier at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface was efficiently eliminated. Dramatically enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.5% was afforded, which is comparable to or even better than that of the reference device with 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis(N,N'-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as HTM under equivalent conditions. Besides, TPDI can also function well in its pristine form although the efficiency (13.6%) obtained is slightly lower than that with the device containing doped TPDI as the HTM. Moreover, these newly integrated noble metal-free, vacuum-free and cost effective PSCs exhibited excellent durability during the long term stability measurements for 30 days. The remarkable performance as well as dramatically reduced fabrication cost demonstrated by integrating TPDI as the HTM and cost effective commercial carbon as the cathode revealed their great potential in the scalable and practical application of PSCs.\"]\n",

      "['Hole transport matertial (HTM) as charge selective layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) plays an important role in achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE). It is known that the dopants and additives are necessary in the HTM in order to improve the hole conductivity of the HTM as well as to obtain high efficiency in PSCs, but the additives can potentially induce device instability and poor device reproducibility. In this work a new strategy to design dopant-free HTMs has been presented by modifying the HTM to include charged moieties which are accompanied with counter ions. The device based on this ionic HTM X44 dos not need any additional doping and the device shows an impressive PCE of 16.2%. Detailed characterization suggests that the incorporated counter ions in X44 can significantly affect the hole conductivity and the homogeneity of the formed HTM thin film. The superior photovoltaic performance for X44 is attributed to both efficient hole transport and effective interfacial hole transfer in the solar cell device. This work provides important insights as regards the future design of new and efficient dopant free HTMs for photovotaics or other optoelectronic applications.']\n",

The surface properties can be improved by coating the scaffold with cellulose nanofibrils material (CNF), a multiscale hydrophilic biocompatible biomaterial derived from wood. In this study, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were cultured on tissue culture plates (TCP) and 3D printed PCL scaffolds coated with CNF. Cellular responses to the surfaces (viability, attachment, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation) were documented. CNF significantly enhanced the hydrophilic properties of PCL scaffolds and promoted protein adsorption. Live/dead staining and lactate dehydrogenase release assays confirmed that CNF did not inhibit cellular viability. The CNF between the 3D printed PCL strands and pores acted as a hydrophilic barrier, enhancing cell seeding efficiency, and proliferation. CNF supported the formation of a well-organized actin cytoskeleton and cellular production of vinculin protein on the surfaces of TCP and PCL scaffolds. Moreover, CNF-coated surfaces enhanced not only alkaline phosphatase activity, but also collagen Type-I and mineral formation. It is concluded that CNF coating enhances cell attachment, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation and has the potential to improve the performance of 3D printed PCL scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.']\n",

These predictions are validated through sound transmission measurements. Passive damping treatment is a common way to reduce structural vibration and sound radiation, but they often have little effect on sound transmission. Visco-elastic damping with a constraining layer is applied to two honeycomb panels with standard and enhanced fluid coupling properties. This enhanced fluid coupling in one of the test panels is due to an extended coincidence range observed from the dispersion curves. The influence of damping treatments on the sound transmission loss of these panels is investigated. Results show that, after the damping treatment, the sound transmission loss of an acoustically bad panel and a normal panel are very similar.']\n",

A fundamental drawback of the method is the use of staircase boundary approximations, giving inconsistent results. Usually experience of numerical experiments provides guidance of the impact of these errors on the final simulation result. In this paper, we derive exact discrete solutions to the Yee scheme close to the staircase approximated boundary, enabling a detailed theoretical study of the amplitude, phase and frequency errors created. Furthermore, we show how evanescent waves of amplitude occur along the boundary. These characterize the inconsistencies observed in electromagnetic simulations and the locality of the waves explain why, in practice, the Yee scheme works as well as it does.

      "[\"Microscopic jets of cryogenic substances such as liquid nitrogen are important regenerative high-density targets for high-repetition rate, high-brightness laser-plasma soft x-ray sources. When operated in vacuum such liquid jets exhibit several non-classical instabilities that negatively influence the x-ray source's spatial and temporal stability, yield, and brightness, parameters that all are important for applications such as water-window microscopy. In the present paper, we investigate liquid-nitrogen jets with a flash-illumination imaging system that allows for a quantitative stability analysis with high spatial and temporal resolution. Direct and indirect consequences of evaporation are identified as the key reasons for the observed instabilities. Operating the jets in an approximately 100 mbar ambient atmosphere counteracts the effects of evaporation and produces highly stable liquid nitrogen jets. For operation in vacuum, which is necessary for the laser plasmas, we improve the stability by introducing an external radiative heating element. The method significantly extends the distance from the nozzle that can be used for liquid-jet laser plasmas, which is of importance for high-average-power applications. Finally, we show that laser-plasma operation with the heating-element-stabilized jet shows improved short-term and long-term temporal stability in its water-window x-ray emission.\"]\n",

Current methods used in the field are time consuming and offer relatively little control of external or test parameters. A pendulum rig has been used for this investigation and adapted to measure railhead friction levels under various states of contamination. The rig consists of an aluminium tubular pendulum; on the end of which is a spring mounted, rubber pad (slider pad). The rig functions on the same principles as used in a Charpy impact test, i.e. energy is lost as the slider pad comes into contact with a surface (in this case the rail head). This loss in kinetic energy is measured and can be translated into a friction coefficient. Tests have been carried out to validate the placing of the contaminants on the rail prior to testing and also to determine the setup of the rig. High speed video has also been used to determine the speed of the slider. The pendulum was also tested in the field and showed good correlation in comparison with a hand pushed Tribometer. Pendulum results have been compared to those from twin disk simulations of the wheel/rail contact and good correlation can also be found.']\n",

This paper presents an experiment performed in a mini-traction machine to simulate the problems of low adhesion in the wheel-rail contact. Tests were conducted under dry conditions and using water or oil as lubricants to study the influence of surface roughness on the adhesion coefficient. The results indicate that the adhesion coefficient can be reduced to as low as 0.02 for smooth surfaces lubricated with water. For rougher contact surfaces, the water-lubricated tests indicate a higher adhesion coefficient than do oil-lubricated ones, but also a clear dependence on water temperature. The oil-lubricated tests indicate a very slight dependence of the adhesion coefficient on variation in rolling speed, temperature, and surface roughness.']\n",

The proposed method is a pendulum rig, which has a rubber pad at the base of a swinging arm. The arm is released and as the rubber pad slides across the contact surface, energy is lost. This loss can be translated into a friction coefficient. Tests have been performed under dry and contaminated conditions, including water, oil and leaf layers both in the laboratory on extracted rail and in the field on live rail. Friction modifiers were also tested. The results of these tests are compared with data obtained using a hand-pushed tribometer.

      "['Commercially available friction modifiers are used in many different countries that have widely different atmospheric conditions. These variations in atmospheric conditions lead to varying levels of railhead oxidation and debris build-up. Friction modifiers can be applied to the rail without any prior cleaning of the rail and this can lead to varying friction modifier/iron oxide ratios potentially affecting the performance of the friction modifier. This paper reports the results of an investigation that was performed to determine the effects of varying atmospheric and oxide conditions on the performance of friction modifiers. A pin-on-disk test rig with an attached environmental chamber was used for the study. Results show that relative humidity has a pronounced effect on the way in which the friction modifier affects friction levels, and also the amount of time it remains on the disk. This also depends on the concentration of oxide in the friction modifier. Glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy analysis was also carried out to assess the effect of the friction modifier and atmospheric conditions on the chemical composition of the surface of the disk. Results show that the depth of surface modification is vastly different depending on the conditions and level of railhead debris.']\n",

      "['This article presents a probabilistic algorithm for representing and learning complex manipulation activities performed by humans in everyday life. The work builds on the multi-level Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) framework which allows decomposition of longer-term complex manipulation activities into layers of abstraction whereby the building blocks can be represented by simpler action modules called action primitives. This way, human task knowledge can be synthesised in a compact, effective representation suitable, for instance, to be subsequently transferred to a robot for imitation. The main contribution is the use of a robust framework capable of dealing with the uncertainty or incomplete data inherent to these activities, and the ability to represent behaviours at multiple levels of abstraction for enhanced task generalisation. Activity data from 3D video sequencing of human manipulation of different objects handled in everyday life is used for evaluation. A comparison with a mixed generative-discriminative hybrid model HHMM/SVM (support vector machine) is also presented to add rigour in highlighting the benefit of the proposed approach against comparable state of the art techniques.']\n",

In the experimental work, dilute hydrochloric acid has been added to an agitated aqueous solution of sodium salicylate in 1 L scale, and product crystals have been characterized by image analysis. The results show that the product crystal number mean size at first increases with increasing agitation rate but then gradually decreases again at further increase in stirring rate. At lower stirring rate, larger crystals are obtained when the feeding point is located close to the agitator instead of being located out in the bulk solution. The mean crystal size increases with decreasing feeding rate and with decreasing reactant concentrations. There is a decrease in mean size with increasing feed pipe diameter. These trends in the experimental results show great similarity with previous results on benzoic acid. The experimental results have been examined by a population balance model accounting for meso and micro mixing, and crystal nucleation and growth rate dispersion. It is found that the crystallization kinetic parameter estimation is quite complex, and the objective function hyper surface contains many different minima. Hence, parameter estimation has to rely on a combination of mathematical optimization strategies and a scientific understanding of the physical meaning of the parameters and their relation to current theories. As opposed to our previous work on benzoic acid, it has not been possible to find a set of kinetic parameters that provides for a good description of all experimental data.']\n",

The nanoindentation measurements reveal that the hardness of the carbide is comparable to the hardest transition metal carbides that have been reported previously. The origin of the super-high hardness is postulated to be due to the inherent bond strength and the large coherency strains that are generated when the carbide demixes within the miscibility gap. The high hardness is maintained at a high level even after 500 h aging treatment at 1300°C. Therefore, it is believed that the new superhard mixed carbide has a high potential in various engineering applications such as in bulk cemented carbide and cermet cutting tools, and in surface coatings.']\n",

The PE structures were constructed by first generating atomistic PE configurations with an off-lattice Monte Carlo method and then equilibrating the structures at the desired temperature and pressure using molecular dynamics simulations. Semicrystalline, fully crystalline and fully amorphous PE, in some cases including crosslinks and short-chain branches, were analyzed. The modeled PE had a structure in agreement with established experimental data. Linear-scaling density functional theory (LS-DFT) was used to examine the electronic structure (e.g., spatial distribution of molecular orbitals, bandgaps and mobility edges) on all the materials, whereas conventional DFT was used to validate the LS-DFT results on small systems. When hybrid functionals were used, the simulated bandgaps were close to the experimental values. The localization of valence and conduction band states was demonstrated. The localized states in the conduction band were primarily found in the free volume (result of gauche conformations) present in the amorphous regions. For branched and crosslinked structures, the localized electronic states closest to the valence band edge were positioned at branches and crosslinks, respectively. At 0 K, the activation energy for transport was lower for holes than for electrons. However, at room temperature, the effective activation energy was very low (similar to 0.1 eV) for both holes and electrons, which indicates that the mobility will be relatively high even belowthe mobility edges and suggests that charge carriers can be hot carriers above the mobility edges in the presence of a high electrical field.']\n",

Integrated, participatory approaches are theoretically linked to improved learning amongst stakeholders across sectors and decision-making that is grounded in shared knowledge, experiences and scientific evidence. However, few studies have empirically examined the impacts of an integrated approach to learning and knowledge practices related to water resources.Here, a Swedish sub-catchment that has adopted such an approach in association with implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is examined. Interview-based analyses show that WFD implementation has both helped and hindered learning and knowledge practices surrounding both water planning and spatial planning. Whilst communities of practice have developed in the study area, a number of important challenges remain. These include the rigid goal-orientation of the WFD, the fragmentation of knowledge caused by an over-reliance on external consultants, as well as a lack of resources to synthesise information from multiple sources.

The conjugation length was systematically increased, which resulted in two effects: first, it led to a red-shift of the optical absorption of the dyes, resulting in an improved spectral overlap with the solar spectrum. Secondly, the oxidation potential decreased systematically. The excited state levels were, however, calculated to be nearly stationary. The experimental trends were in excellent agreement with density functional theory (DFT) computations. The photovoltaic performance of this set of dyes as sensitizers in mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> solar cells was investigated using electrolytes containing the iodide/triiodide redox couple. The dye with the best absorption characteristics showed the poorest solar cell efficiency, due to losses by recombination of electrons in TiO<sub>2</sub> with triiodide. Addition of 4-<em>tert</em> butylpyridine to the electrolyte led to a strongly reduced photocurrent for all dyes due to a reduced electron injection efficiency, caused by a 0.15 V negative shift of the TiO<sub>2</sub> conduction band potential.']\n",

To produce low-cost dyes, much work is being directed toward synthesizing all-organic, ruthenium-free dyes with high extinction coefficients and broad absorption bands with large solar spectrum overlap. One of the best dyes, the polyene-diphenylaniline dye D5L2A1, has a rather blue absorption with an IPCE onset at around 650 nm, but it still has an energy conversion efficiency of almost 6%. To increase the overlap with the solar spectrum, the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group was changed to rhodanine-3-acetic acid in complex D5L2A3. This gave an IPCE onset at around 750 nm, but unfortunately, it also decreased the overall efficiency to a modest 1.7%. By femtosecond transient absorption, we show that the electron injections into TiO2 for the two dyes are ultrafast and indistinguishable with our time resolution (&lt; 200 fs). However, charge recombination is also ultrafast, with different fractions of a ca. 500-fs component for the two dyes. Yet, the fraction of the faster decay component is larger for D5L2A3 than for D5L2A1. Here, we provide an interpretation of the implications of changing anchoring group. We believe that a lack of electron density oil the binding oxygens of the D5L2A3 LUMO, due to the rhodanine group, promotes a higher probability for electron injection to short-lived surface trap states compared to the situation for the fully conjugated D5L2A1.']\n",

Terrylene-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells yielded good photocurrents providing more than 60% in external quantum efficiency. The photoinduced electron transfer from the dye to TiO2 was found to be very sensitive to conduction band edge shifts in TiO2 induced, either by changes in the composition of the redox electrolyte or by UV-illumination. This sensitivity was observed in quantum efficiencies for photocurrent generation of terrylene-sensitized solar cells and in photoinduced absorption experiments. The conduction band shifts were quantified using charge extraction methods. The observed sensitivity of the injection efficiency suggests that photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the relaxed excited state, possibly due to poor electronic coupling between TMIMA excited states and TiO2 conduction band states.']\n",

We have investigated the structure, especially the nature of orientational disorder of caffeine molecules as a function of temperature in the range of 400-550 K. Experimentally this system is known to undergo a phase transition at 426 K (considered to be an orientational order-disorder transition) and melt at 512 K. Our simulations reproduce these two transitions in excellent agreement with experiment. We find that the in-plane reorientational motion of molecules is restricted to small angles below 425 K, and above this temperature, molecules undergo essentially free rotations in molecular plane, and we find the melting to occur between 525 and 550 K. In the high temperature disordered phase, the disorder is mostly attributable to the in-plane orientational motion of the molecules. The potential energy profile for the in-plane reorientational rotation has six wells as a consequence of specific packing of molecules in the ab crystallographic plane. Also we find considerable out-of-plane reorientational disorder for the molecules in the high temperature disordered phase. We have also studied the structure and orientational disorder of the system that is quenched from 450 to 300 K.

An important feature of the contract was that it contained a combination of measures that should be carried out and properties of the bridges that the contractor was responsible to maintain. This created a balance between predictability and flexibility for the contractor. The client was satisfied because of increased competence and a low price. The latter can partly be explained by the possibility for the specialised bridge crew to get additional work from other sectors. One problem was that some properties were difficult to measure, which led to some controversies.

The underlying theoretical arguments for its design and the performed pilot projects which have informed its implementation are also presented. The outcome of performed certifications is discussed in terms of stakeholder response; in terms of whether to certify artefact, processes, or both; and in terms of the relationship between software certification, standardisation, and public procurement agreements.

A second conclusion is that the buying organisation has to implement integrative processes in which its organisational development and its implementation of IT systems are coordinated. Conclusions are also drawn with respect to the set of organisational patterns underlying the UsersAward initiative-certifications, user panels, user surveys, user conferences and a yearly IT Prize contest.

      "[\"Clear-cut cases of decision-making under risk (known probabilities) are unusual in real life. The gambler's decisions at the roulette table are as close as we can get to this type of decision-making. In contrast, decision-making under uncertainty (unknown probabilities) can be exemplified by a decision whether to enter a jungle that may contain unknown dangers. Life is usually more like an expedition into an unknown jungle than a visit to the casino. Nevertheless, it is common in decision-supporting disciplines to proceed as if reasonably reliable probability estimates were available for all possible outcomes, i.e. as if the prevailing epistemic conditions were analogous to those of gambling at the roulette table. This mistake can be called the tuxedo fallacy. It is argued that traditional engineering practices such as safety factors and multiple safety barriers avoid this fallacy and that they therefore manage uncertainty better than probabilistic risk analysis (PRA). PRA is a useful tool, but it must be supplemented with other methods in order not to limit the analysis to dangers that can be assigned meaningful probability estimates.\"]\n",

By suitable application of an auxiliary electric field and adjustment of its internal location, width and amplitude, strongly decreased levels of dynamo fluctuations are obtained. The simulations are performed using a fully non-linear, resistive magnetohydrodynamic model, including the effects of ohmic heating as well as parallel and perpendicular heat conduction along stochastic field lines. The importance of controlling the parallel current profile in the core plasma to minimize the effects of tearing modes on confinement is thus confirmed. A near three-fold increase in energy confinement is found and poloidal plasma beta increases by 30% from 0.20 to 0.27. The edge heat flux is reduced to a third of that of the conventional RFP. The high-confinement phase is interrupted here by a crash, characterized by a rapid decrease in confinement. A detailed study of the crash phase is carried out by the standard Delta' theory and a fully resistive linearized time-spectral method; the generalized weighted residual method.

The deposition of particles in a horizontal channel may clog the flow path. The purpose of this paper is to extend the use of a developed Eulerian deposition model to liquid flows in horizontal straight channels to predict the particle deposition rate. For a horizontal pipe, the deposition rates may differ greatly along a cross section, due to the influences of gravity and buoyancy. The current deposition model is first applied to air flows to enable a comparison with available experimental data. Then, the model is applied to liquid flows in horizontal straight pipes. The effects of gravity, buoyancy, water flow rates, wall roughness, particle size and temperature difference in the near-wall boundary layer on the deposition rate have been studied and explained. The results show that the deposition rates of particles increase with an increased flow rate. The gravity separation has a large influence on the deposition of large particle at high and low parts of the horizontal pipe in some flows. Moreover, both the wall roughness and thermophoresis have a significant influence on the deposition rate of small particles. In addition, the roughness also shows an important influence on the large particle deposition at the top of the investigated pipe, due to that a large value of roughness can make the deposition location somewhat far away from the wall, where a stronger turbophoresis exists. The intensity of the turbophoresis relative to the gravity separation before a particle is reaching the deposition location is important for the large particle deposition when the gravity separation play a negative role on the deposition rate.

The application used contained a flat surface in a 3D interface on which piles of cubes were randomly placed in a grid. The task involved scanning for empty cells and placing continuously falling cubes until all empty cells were filled. The cubes and the flat surface were designed in such a way that they could be felt and heard and thus could be recognized by different kinds of haptic and audio feedback cues. This made it possible to scan the environment and read both absolute and relative positions in the grid. A quantitative analysis of task performance and a qualitative analysis of video recordings and interview data were performed. Results showed that task completion times were significantly faster in the visual/haptic/audio condition compared with the other conditions and that there were also significantly fewer errors, result checks of one's own actions and double checks of the partner's actions in the visual/haptic/audio condition than in the other conditions. Qualitative results show that participants work simultaneously to a larger extent in the visual/haptic/audio condition and that less communication occurred in the visual/haptic/audio condition compared with the other conditions.

Most studies of the robustness of PTN have focused on network topology and considered vulnerability in terms of connectivity reliability. While these studies provide insights on general design principles, there is lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of different strategies to reduce the impacts of disruptions. This paper proposes and demonstrates a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of a strategic increase in capacity on alternative PTN links to mitigate the impact of unexpected network disruptions. The evaluation approach consists of two stages: identifying a set of important links and then for each identified important link, a set of capacity enhancement schemes is evaluated. The proposed method integrates stochastic supply and demand models, dynamic route choice and limited operational capacity. This dynamic agent-based modelling of network performance enables to capture cascading network effects as well as the adaptive redistribution of passenger flows. An application for the rapid PTN of Stockholm, Sweden, demonstrates how the proposed method could be applied to sequentially designed scenarios based on their performance indicators.

For the five-dimensional model, the results hat we obtained agree reasonably well with the results that have previously been presented in the literature, whereas for the six-dimensional model, we find that, at tree-level, the results are the same as for the five-dimensional model. Finally, if the first Kaluza-Klein mode of the U(1) gauge boson constitutes the dark matter, IceCube can constrain the parameter space. However, in the case that the neutral component of the SU(2) gauge bosons is the LKP, the signal is too weak to be observed.']\n",

This is to our knowledge the first model where flavour symmetries are applied simultaneously to active and sterile neutrinos explaining at the same time active neutrino properties and this peculiar Dark Matter scenario. The essential point is that different scales of the symmetry breaking and the symmetry preserving entries in the mass matrix lead to one right- handed neutrino which is nearly massless compared to the other two. Furthermore, we naturally predict vanishing theta(13) and maximal theta(23), while the correct value of theta(12) must come from the mixing of the charged leptons. We can furthermore predict an exact mass spectrum for the light neutrinos, which will be testable in the very near future.']\n",

The secondary fluid was prepared by mixing ethyl alcohol and water to obtain initial alcohol concentration of 10.3% (initial freezing temperature -4.4 degrees C). The pressure drop tests were conducted to cover laminar and slightly turbulent flow with ice mass fraction varying from 0% to 30% depending on test conditions. Results from flow tests reveal much higher pressure drop for higher ice concentrations and higher velocities in comparison to the single phase flow. However for ice concentrations of 15% and higher, certain velocity exists at which ice slurry pressure drop is same or even lower than for single phase flow. It seems that higher ice concentration delay flow pattern transition moment (from laminar to turbulent) toward higher velocities. In addition experimental results for pressure drop were compared to the analytical results, based on Poiseulle and Buckingham-Reiner models for laminar flow, Blasius. Darby and Melson, Dodge and Metzner, Steffe and Tomita for turbulent region and general correlation of Kitanovski which is valid for both flow regimes. For laminar flow and low buoyancy numbers Buckingham-Reiner method gives good agreement with experimental results while for turbulent flow best fit is provided with Dodge-Metzner and Tomita methods.

Various distance frames in the refrigerant channel were also employed to study the influence of the refrigerant mass flux on two-phase flow heat transfer. The tests were conducted at heat fluxes ranging between 4.5 kW/m(2) and 17 kW/m(2) with 134a as refrigerant. Pool boiling tests of the enhancement structure, under similar conditions and at various surface inclination angles, were also performed for reasons of comparison. The plate heat exchanger with the enhancement structure displayed up to ten times enhanced heat transfer coefficient in the refrigerant channel, resulting in an improvement in the overall heat transfer coefficient with over 100%. This significant boiling enhancement is in agreement with previous pool boiling experiments and confirms that the enhancement structure may be used to enhance the performance of plate heat exchangers. A simple superposition model was used to evaluate the results, and it was found that, primarily, the convective boiling mechanism was affected by the distance frames in the standard heat exchanger. On the other hand, with the enhanced boiling structure, variations in hydraulic diameter in the refrigerant channel caused a significant change in the nucleate boiling mechanism, which accounted for the largest effect on the heat transfer performance.']\n",

      "[\"Gas-phase heat transfer plays a critical role in many high temperature applications, such as preheaters, combustors, and other thermal equipment. In such cases common heat transfer augmentation methods rely on the convective component alone to achieve improved internal performance. Radiatively assisted heat transfer augmentation has been suggested as a way to overcome limitations in convective-only enhancement. One example of such a technique is the fiber array insert; thermal radiation emitted by tube walls is captured by a large number of slender fibers, which in turn convect heat to the flowing fluid. Previous numerical studies have indicated that this technique represents a promising enhancement method warranting further investigation. This paper presents results from an experimentally based feasibility study of fiber array inserts for heat transfer augmentation in an externally heated duct. Fibers composed of 140 mu m silicon carbide and 150 mu m stainless steel were assembled in arrays with porosities around 0.98, and were tested for empty-tube Reynolds numbers ranging from 17,500 to 112,500 and wall temperatures from ambient up to 750 degrees C. The arrays cause a significant pressure drop-roughly two orders of magnitude higher than the empty-tube case-but tube-side heat transfer coefficients were improved by up to 100% over the convective-only case in the low flow rate regime. The stainless steel fiber array exhibited similar heat transfer performance as the silicon carbide case, although pressure drop characteristics differed owing to variations in fluid-structure flow phenomena. Pressure drop data were roughly within the range of d'Arcy law predictions for both arrays, and deviations could be explained by inhomogeneities in fiber-to-fiber spacing. Heat transfer was found to depend nonlinearly on wall temperature and flow rate, in contrast to previously reported numerical data.\"]\n",

The simultaneous measurement on the same liquid film shows that the two techniques are in a good agreement with respect to accuracy, but the optical sensors have a much higher acquisition rate up to 30 kHz which is more suitable for rapid process. The optical sensors are therefore used to measure the instantaneous film thickness in an isothermal flow over a silicon wafer, obtaining the film thickness profile and the interfacial wave. The dynamic thickness of an evaporating film on a horizontal silicon wafer surface is also recorded by the optical sensor for the first time. The results indicate that the critical thickness initiating film instability on the silicon wafer is around 84 mu m at heat flux of similar to 56 kW/m(2). In general, the tests performed show that the confocal optical sensor is capable of measuring liquid film dynamics at various conditions, while the micro-conductive probe can be used to calibrate the optical sensor by simultaneous measurement of a film under quasi-steady state. The micro-experimental methods provide the solid platform for further investigation of the liquid film dynamics affected by physicochemical properties of the liquid and surfaces as well as thermal-hydraulic conditions.']\n",

By comparison with flat silicon surfaces, which are oleophilic, it has been demonstrated that a combination of low surface energy and the structured features of the plasma-etched surface is essential to prevent oil from penetrating the surface cavities and thus induce the observed macroscopic superoleophobic phenomena with very low contact-angle hysteresis and low roll-off angles. The structured silicon surfaces were coated with cellulose nanocrystals using the polyelectrolyte multilayer technique.

Traditionally technical fibre flows are modelled as flow of fibres in a suspending medium. Here they are treated as crowded flows of fibre flocs from which the liquid may be squeezed in and out from. Compressive flows are common in the fibre-based process industry. They can e.g. be found in the head-box of a paper machine, in extruder nozzles in polymer technology, in the stirrer zone of mixers, etc. Traditionally such flows are analysed in elongational flow terms. Here it will be demonstrated that elongational and compressive flows for technical fibres suspensions differ qualitatively. The nature of technical fibre flocs is also discussed. For historic reasons they have come to be regarded as the outcome of a flocculation process of electrostatic-colloidal and/or mechanical-entanglement type. It will be shown that such a process is unnecessary for technical fibre suspensions and that these flocs are qualitatively different, viz. frozen-developed dissipative structures of the flocky fibre flow from which they originate. It will also be demonstrated that technical fibre flocs, in contrast with flocs of the chemically flocked type, are basically non-coherent, i.e. not kept together by themselves.

Genome-scale metabolic modeling can reveal limitations in cyanobacteria metabolism and guide genetic engineering strategies to increase chemical production. Here, we used constraint-based modeling and optimization algorithms on a genome-scale model of Synechocystis PCC6803 to find ways to improve productivity of fermentative, fatty-acid, and terpene-derived fuels. OptGene and MOMA were used to find heuristics for knockout strategies that could increase biofuel productivity. OptKnock was used to find a set of knockouts that led to coupling between biofuel and growth. Our results show that high productivity of fermentation or reversed beta-oxidation derived alcohols such as 1-butanol requires elimination of NADH sinks, while terpenes and fatty-acid based fuels require creating imbalances in intracellular ATP and NADPH production and consumption. The FBA-predicted productivities of these fuels are at least 10-fold higher than those reported so far in the literature. We also discuss the physiological and practical feasibility of implementing these knockouts. This work gives insight into how cyanobacteria could be engineered to reach competitive biofuel productivities.']\n",

The present publication investigates theoretically the temperature behavior of metal zone plates on a diamond substrate irradiated by 0.1 nm X-rays from the European X-ray Free Electron Laser. The heat transfer in the optic is simulated by solving the transient heat equation with the finite element method. Two different zone plate designs are considered, one small zone plate placed in the direct beam and one larger zone plate after the monochromator. The main result is that for all investigated cases the maximum temperature in the metal zone plate layer is at least a factor 2 below the melting point of the respective material, proving the efficiency of the proposed cooling scheme. However, zone plates in the direct beam experience large and rapid temperature fluctuations of several hundred Kelvin that might prove fatal to the optic. The situation is different for optics behind the monochromator with fluctuations in the 20 K range and maximum temperatures well below room temperature. The simulation results give valuable indications on the temperature behavior to be expected and are a basis for future experimental heat transfer and mechanical stability investigations of fabricated nanostructures.']\n",

There are well-established methods for determining residual stresses in paper, and some knowledge exists of how to control and tailor the residual stresses. However, there is an increasing demand to be able to tailor paper grades with respect to their mechanical properties. Pulp fibres are commonly beaten to improve the mechanical performance, but beating also increases the sheet density, de-watering resistance, and residual stresses of the paper produced. This work examines whether beating and the addition of chemical additives, i.e., a single layer of poly(allylamine) or a multilayer of poly(allylamine) and poly(acrylic acid), exert different effects on the build-up of residual stresses in paper. Both beating the fibres and adding polyelectrolytes increased the in-plane strength, stiffness, and residual stresses of the paper sheets prepared. The fact that the residual stresses did not scale linearly with the stiffness of the prepared sheets suggests that both beating and polyelectrolyte addition made the fibre/fibre joints transfer load at a lower solids content, such that stresses were transferred between fibre layers in the sheet earlier in the drying process, thus increasing the residual stresses. The fact that the strength gain when building polyelectrolyte multilayers induced less residual stresses than when the strength was increased by beating indicates the possibilities for producing paper with high strength but less residual stress.']\n",

To evaluate the ability of Cr(VI) and Mo(VI) additions to hinder hypochlorite reduction, potential sweep experiments on rotating disc electrodes and cathodic current efficiency (CE) measurements on stationary electrodes were performed. Formed electrode films were investigated with scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Cathodic hypochlorite reduction is hindered by the Mo-containing films formed on the cathode surface after Mo(VI) addition to the electrolyte, but much less efficient compared to Cr(VI) addition. Very low levels of Cr(VI), in the mM range, can efficiently suppress hypochlorite reduction on polished titanium and steel. Phosphate does not negatively influence the CE in the presence of Cr(VI) or Mo(VI) but the Mo-containing cathode films become thinner if the electrolyte during the film build-up also contains phosphate.

The AFM images reveal the micro-and nano-structure of and pinholes in the coatings as well as their changes during exposure in the solution, whereas the EIS spectra vs. time of exposure show the barrier property, stability and degradation of the coatings. The coating with crosslinking and high level of hydrophobicity exhibited a high barrier property and long-term corrosion protection in the solution despite of some shallow pinholes. The coating without crosslinking but having high Tg and high level of hydrophobicity also displayed a high barrier property and certain stability although initial changes occur in the solution. However, for the coating without crosslinking and with low Tg and relative low level of hydrophobicity, some dissolution and open-up of defects occurred on the surface shortly after exposure and the coating lost its barrier property rapidly in the solution.

This paper investigates the nanofibril orientation distribution of films of partly oriented cellulose nanofibrils. Stripes of hydrogel films were subjected to different amount of strain and, after drying, examined with X-ray diffraction to obtain the orientation of the nanofibrils in the films, caused by the stretching. The cellulose nanofibrils had initially a random in-plane orientation in the hydrogel films and the strain was applied to the films before the nanofibrils bond tightly together, which occurs during drying. The stretching resulted in a reorientation of the nanofibrils in the films, with monotonically increasing orientation towards the load direction with increasing strain. Estimation of nanofibril reorientation by X-ray diffraction enables quantitative comparison of the stretch-induced orientation ability of different cellulose nanofibril systems. The reorientation of nanofibrils as a consequence of an applied strain is also predicted by a geometrical model of deformation of nanofibril hydrogels. Conversely, in high-strain cold-drawing of wet cellulose nanofibril materials, the enhanced orientation is promoted by slipping of the effectively stiff fibrils.']\n",

We evaluate their behaviour in uni-axial and bi-axial compression with cyclic loading. The secondary loading cycles reveal complete irreversible damage of the microstructure, with the secondary loading path being characterised by near zero plateau stress. In force controlled tests, negligible hysteresis corroborates the idea that there is no energy dissipation owing to near complete microstructural damage. Furthermore, we observe no indications of preferential orientation of the microstructure in these tests. The stress responses in mutually perpendicular directions are seen to be identical, within statistical considerations. We then utilise the “pseudo-elastic-\\x9d model developed and adopt it to the case of highly compressible Ogden strain energy formulation with a modified neo-Hookean for the unloading, with a view of fitting a continuum hyperelastic model to the experimental data. The material parameters obtained from uni-axial data are seen to be insufficient to describe the more general bi-axial deformation.

In the plating bath without gelatin, the results indicate that stronger convection promotes hydrogen evolution, which reduces the current efficiency during copper plating. Gelatin restrains the growth of copper grains in the lateral direction parallel to the surface. This results in grain refinement on the shiny side, an increase in local grain misorientation and in internal stresses on both the shiny and the matte side, and a reduction in their internal stress difference. At strong convection conditions and with gelatin present, copper deposits as strip-like grains along the centrifugal direction of the cross section, and finally forms a spiral-shaped pattern on the matte side. The causes of these features are discussed in detail. The combined influences of hydrogen and gelatin adsorption are further elaborated in a model for a copper deposition. The current investigation suggests that a moderate convection (somewhat lower than 1000 rpm) and a concentration of 2 ppm gelatin in the plating bath are sufficient for copper foil fabrication in the presence of chloride ions (20 ppm).']\n",

We report experimental and theoretical characterizations of dynamic optical properties of multi-shell-coated CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs. Quantum-mechanical studies of fundamental optical excitations and Monte Carlo simulations of energy relaxation mechanisms indicate that the excitonic states are densely compacted in the QDs and are easily photoexcited by the laser pulse in the presence of nonradiative electron-phonon interactions. For spherical QDs, the decay time of spontaneous radiative emission of individual photoexcited excitonic states with zero angular momenta is found to be only tens of picoseconds. In our multi-shell QDs, high-energy excitonic states of nonzero angular momenta have to go through a number of nonradiative electron-phonon interaction steps in order to relax to zero-angular-momentum excitonic states for radiative emission, resulting in an effective fluorescence peak at about 2 ns in the photoncount-time relationship. This explains the measured long average fluorescence lifetime of 3.6 ns. Such a long lifetime facilitates the applications of colloidal QDs in areas such as QD-based solar cells, bioimaging and metamaterials.']\n",

The surface recombination velocity (SRV) at the exposed hole sidewalls is determined from the measured carrier lifetimes of the PhC fields with different lattice parameters. The observed variation in the SRV with etch duration also confirms the presence of accumulated sidewall damage.

This paper presents a study of how running-in affects the dry elastic contact area ratio in spur gears using real surface topographies from three common manufacturing methods (green-shaving, honing, and grinding). The test gears were manufactured in case-hardened steel, similar to 20MnCrS5. Surface topography measurements were used as input to a contact analysis boundary element software program. An important hypothesis used in this work is that the dry elastic contact area ratio, i.e. the ratio between real and nominal contact area, can be used as a measure of the contact conditions in gears. It is concluded that running-in differs significantly for the studied manufacturing methods and that the dry elastic contact area ratio gives a consistent description of these changes. The shaved gears have the highest dry elastic contact area ratio after running in, where the ground gears have the lowest dry elastic contact area ratio. The increase in dry elastic contact area ratio is about 30 per cent for the shaved gears, 12 per cent for the honed gears and less than 5 per cent for the ground gears. Extreme value parameters, such as R(p) and R(z), showed relatively good correlation to dry elastic contact area ratio.

In this study we address whether superhydrophobic coatings could be used as part of an environmentally friendly corrosion-protective system, and specific focus is put on how the wetting regime of a superhydrophobic coating affects corrosion inhibition. Superhydrophobic alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) wax coatings were produced, using different methods resulting in hierarchical structures, where the coatings exhibit the same surface chemistry but different wetting regimes. Contact angle measurements, ESEM, confocal Raman microscopy, open circuit potential and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to evaluate the surfaces. Remarkably high impedance values of 1010Î©cm2 (at 10-2Hz) were reached for the sample showing superhydrophobic lotus-like wetting. Simultaneous open circuit potential measurements suggest that the circuit is broken, most likely due to the formation of a thin air layer at the coating-water interface that inhibits ion transport from the electrolyte to the metal substrate. The remaining samples, showing superhydrophobic wetting in the rose state and hydrophobic Wenzel-like wetting, showed less promising corrosion-protective properties. Due to the absence of air films on these surfaces the coatings were penetrated by the electrolyte, which allowed the corrosion reaction to proceed.']\n",

These materials combine the unique properties of nanometer-scale objects with the ability to present multiple copies of carbohydrate ligands, greatly enhancing the weak affinity of individual ligands to their binding partners. Critical to the performance of glyconanomaterials is the proper display of carbohydrate ligands, taking into consideration of the coupling chemistry, the type and length of the spacer linkage, and the ligand density. This article provides an overview of the coupling chemistry for attaching carbohydrate ligands to nanomaterials, and discusses the need for thorough characterization of glyconanomaterials, especially quantitative analyses of the ligand density and binding affinities. Using glyconanoparticles synthesized by a versatile photocoupling chemistry, methods for determining the ligand density by colorimetry and the binding affinity with lectins by a fluorescence competition assay are determined. The results show that the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands significantly enhances the binding affinity by several orders of magnitude in comparison to the free ligands in solution. The effect is sizeable even at low surface ligand density. The type and length of the spacer linkage also affect the binding affinity, with the longer linkage promoting the association of bound ligands with the corresponding lectins.']\n",

In this Article, we report a new method to measure the binding affinity of glyconanoparticle (GNP)-protein interactions based on a fluorescent competition binding assay, which yielded the apparent dissociation constant (K-d) of GNPs with the interacting protein. Au nanoparticles conjugated with underivatized mono-, oligo-, and polysaccharides were synthesized using our recently developed photocoupling chemistry. The affinities of these GNPs with lectins were measured and were several orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding free ligands with lectins. The effect of ligand display on the binding affinity of GNPs was, furthermore, studied where GNPs of varying linker type, spacer length, ligand density, and nanoparticle size were prepared and K-d values determined. The long spacer linker containing hydrocarbon and ethylene oxide units gave the highest binding affinity as well as assay sensitivity. The binding affinity increased with ligand density in general, showing a drastic increase in affinity at low ligand density. In addition, the affinity enhancement was more pronounced on smaller NPs than the larger ones. These results not only demonstrate that the binding affinity of GNPs is highly influenced by how the ligands are presented on the nanoparticles but also pave the way for tailor-made glyconanomaterials with tunable affinity by way of ligand display.']\n",

      "['Current and voltage have been measured in a pulsed high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) system for discharge pulses longer than 100 mu s. Two different current regimes could clearly be distinguished during the pulses: (1) a high-current transient followed by (2) a plateau at lower currents. These results provide a link between the HiPIMS and the direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) discharge regimes. At high applied negative voltages the high-current transient had the characteristics of HiPIMS pulses, while at lower voltages the plateau values agreed with currents in DCMS using the same applied voltage. The current behavior was found to be strongly correlated with the chamber gas pressure, where increasing gas pressure resulted in increasing peak current and plateau current. Based on these experiments it is suggested here that the high-current transients cause a depletion of the working gas in the area in front of the target, and thereby a transition to a DCMS-like high-voltage, lower current regime.']\n",

Two cases were considered: a population of ORNs that all express the same olfactory receptor (OR), and a population that expresses many different ORs. To take into account ORN variability, we replaced single parameter values in a biophysical ORN model with values drawn from statistical distributions, chosen to correspond to experimental data. For ORNs expressing the same OR, we found that the distributions of firing frequencies are Gaussian at all concentrations, with larger mean and standard deviation at higher concentrations. For a population expressing different ORs, the distribution of firing frequencies can be described as the superposition of a Gaussian distribution and a lognormal distribution. Distributions of maximum value and dynamic range of spiking frequencies in the simulated ORN population were similar to experimental results.']\n",

      "['Striatal fast-spiking (FS) interneurons are interconnected by gap junctions into sparsely connected networks. As demonstrated for cortical FS interneurons, these gap junctions in the striatum may cause synchronized spiking, which would increase the influence that FS neurons have on spiking by the striatal medium spiny (MS) neurons. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is characterized by changes in synchrony or periodicity, thus gap junctions between FS interneurons may modulate synchrony and thereby influence behavior such as reward learning and motor control. To explore the roles of gap junctions on activity and spike synchronization in a striatal FS population, we built a network model of FS interneurons. Each FS connects to 30-40% of its neighbors, as found experimentally, and each FS interneuron in the network is activated by simulated corticostriatal synaptic inputs. Our simulations show that the proportion of synchronous spikes in FS networks with gap junctions increases with increased conductance of the electrical synapse; however, the synchronization effects are moderate for experimentally estimated conductances. Instead, the main tendency is that the presence of gap junctions reduces the total number of spikes generated in response to synaptic inputs in the network. The reduction in spike firing is due to shunting through the gap junctions; which is minimized or absent when the neurons receive coincident inputs. Together these findings suggest that a population of electrically coupled FS interneurons may function collectively as input detectors that are especially sensitive to synchronized synaptic inputs received from the cortex.']\n",

The HWS line chickens are compulsive feeders, whereas, in the LWS line, some individuals are anorexic and others have very low appetites. The involvement of the central nervous system in these behavioural differences has been experimentally supported. We compared a brain region at 0 and 56 days of age containing the major metabolic regulatory regions, including the hypothalamus and brainstem, using a global cDNA array expression analysis. The results obtained show that the long-term selection has produced minor but multiple expression differences. Genes that regulate neuronal plasticity, such as actin filament polymerisation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, were identified as being differentially expressed. Genes involved in lipid metabolism were over-represented among differentially expressed genes. The expression data confirm that neural systems regulating feeding behaviours in these lines are different. The results suggest that the lines are set in separate developmental trajectories equipped with slightly different nervous systems. We suggest that the lines adapt behaviourally different to changing situations post hatch, such as the transition from dependence on yolk to feeding, in order to obtain energy.

      "['The striatum is the main input stage of the basal ganglia system, which is involved in executive functions of the forebrain, such as the planning and the selection of motor behavior. Feedforward inhibition of medium-sized spiny projection neurons in the striatum by fast-spiking interneurons is supposed to be an important determinant of controlling striatal output to later stages of the basal ganglia[1]. Striatal fast-spiking interneurons, which constitute approximately 1-“2% of all striatal neurons, show many similarities to cortical fast-spiking cells. In response to somatic current injection, for example, some of these neurons exhibit spike bursts with a variable number of action potentials (so called stuttering)[2-4]. Interestingly, the membrane potential between such stuttering episodes oscillates in the range of 20-“100 Hz[3,5]. The first spike of each stuttering episode invariably occurs at a peak of the underlying subthreshold oscillation. In both cortex and striatum, fast-spiking cells are inter-connected by gap junctions[6,7]. In vitro measurements as well as theoretical studies indicate that electrical coupling via gap junctions might be able to promote synchronous activity among these neurons[6,8]. Here we investigate the possible role of subthreshold oscillations on the synchronization of sub- and suprathreshold activity in a model of electrically coupled fast-spiking neurons. We use the model of Golomb et al.[3], which we extended with a dendritic tree so as to be able to simulate distal synaptic input. We show that gap junctions are able to synchronize subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations in response to somatic current injection. However, the oscillations are only prevalent in the subthreshold range and therefore require enough membrane potential depolarization[5]. In response to synaptic input, our model neuron only enters the subthreshold oscillatory regime with AMPA and NMDA synapses located at distal dendrites. Proximal synaptic input leads to more random fluctuations of the membrane potential, reflecting a smaller extent of dendritic filtering of the Poisson-distributed postsynaptic potentials. We furthermore investigate the effect of GABAergic (i.e. inhibitory) input to the model of the fast-spiking neuron and predict that inhibitory input is able to induce a stuttering episode in these cells. We finally discuss our results in the context of the feedforward inhibitory network, which is likely to play an important role in striatal and basal ganglia function.']\n",

The cooling of the charged air results in higher density and thus volumetric efficiency. It is also important for petrol engines that the knock margin increases with reduced charge air temperature. A property that is still not very well investigated is the sound transmission through a CAC. The losses, due to viscous and thermal boundary layers as well as turbulence, in the narrow cooling tubes result in frequency dependent attenuation of the transmitted sound that is significant and dependent on the flow conditions. Normally, the cross-sections of the cooling tubes are neither circular nor rectangular, which is why no analytical solution accounting for a superimposed mean flow exists. The cross-dimensions of the connecting tanks, located on each side of the cooling tubes, are large compared to the diameters of the inlet and outlet ducts. Three-dimensional effects will therefore be important at frequencies significantly lower than the cut-on frequencies of the inlet/outlet ducts. In this study the two-dimensional finite element solution scheme for sound propagation in narrow tubes, including the effect of viscous and thermal boundary layers, originally derived by Astley and Cummings [Wave propagation in catalytic converters: Formulation of the problem and finite element scheme, Journal of Sound and Vibration 188 (5) (1995) 635-657] is used to extract two-ports to represent the cooling tubes.

An attractive formalism for representation of the multi-ports based on the admittance relationship between the ports is presented.

The fuel blends that had higher fuel sensitivity were more resistant to autoignition for low intake temperature and high intake pressure and less resistant to autoignition for high intake temperature and low intake pressure. A sensitivity analysis shows that at high intake temperature the chemistry of the fuels ethanol, toluene and diisobutylene helps to advance ignition. This is consistent with the trend that fuels with the least Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) behavior show the highest octane sensitivity, and become less resistant to autoignition at high intake temperatures. For high intake pressure the sensitivity analysis shows that fuels in the fuel blend with no NTC behavior consume OH radicals and acts as a radical scavenger for the fuels with NTC behavior. This is consistent with the observed trend of an increase in RON and fuel sensitivity. With data from shock tube experiments in the literature and HCCI modeling in this work, a correlation between the reciprocal pressure exponent oil the ignition delay to the fuel sensitivity and volume percentage of single-stage ignition fuel in the fuel blend was found. Higher fuel sensitivity and single-stage fuel content generally gives a lower value of the pressure exponent.

Instead we have shown that the contribution of the two pathways leading to autoignition in gasoline containing nitroalkanes becomes much more significant under the more severe conditions of the Motor Octane method than the Research Octane method.']\n",

      "['The split/splitless inlet system has basically the same fundamental drawbacks it had when it was introduced: poor repeatability of the injected amount of sample and discrimination of high-boiling analytes. Hot needle injection improves the repeatability of the sample transfer but suffers from in-needle discrimination. Injection with a fast autosampler, resulting in minimal heating of the needle, solves this problem but usually requires a glass wool packing in the inlet liner to assist in vaporization of the sample. As glass wool has been reported to cause degradation of labile analytes, it cannot be applied as a general remedy for improving incomplete vaporization. In this paper, a novel concept, based on electrostatic nebulization of the injected sample, is presented. The resulting fine droplets promote a more effective heat transfer and a rapid vaporization. Evaluation of the electrospray inlet in the split mode, using a straight, empty glass liner and a cold needle, showed an improvement in peak area repeatability by about 1 order of magnitude, compared with the results obtained when no electrostatic field was applied, Splitless injection of a series of hydrocarbons up to C-28 in the electrospray inlet with an empty, tapered liner, using a cold needle, showed no measurable analyte discrimination.

In particular, the possibility to predict the structure and stability of potential polymorphs of a substance is of tremendous interest to the pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals industry. Molecular mechanics modeling relies on the use of parametrized force fields and methods of assigning point charges to the atoms in the molecules. In commercial molecular simulation software, a wide variety of such combinations are available, and there is a need for critical assessment of the capabilities of the different alternatives. In the present work, the performance of several molecular mechanics force fields combined with different methods for the assignment of atomic point charges have been examined with regard to their ability to calculate absolute crystal lattice energies and their capacity to identify the experimental structure as a minimum on the potential energy hypersurface. Seven small, aromatic monomolecular crystalline compounds are used in the evaluation. It is found that the majority of the examined methods cannot be used to reliably predict absolute lattice energies. The most promising results were obtained with the Pcff force field using integral charges, and the Dreiding force field using Gasteiger charges, both of which performed with an accuracy of the same order of magnitude as the variations in experimental lattice energies. Overall, it has been observed that the best results are achieved if the same force field method is used to relax the crystal structure and calculate the energy, and to optimize and calculate the energy of the gas phase molecule used for the correction for changes in molecular geometry. The Pcff and Compass force fields with integral charges have been found to predict relaxed structures closest to the experimental ones. In addition, five different methods for determining point charges fitted to the electrostatic potential (ESP charges), available in the same software, have been evaluated. For each method, the molecular geometries of 10 small, organic molecules were optimized, and ESP charges calculated and analyzed for linear correlation with a set of reference charges of an accepted standard method, HF/6-31G*. Dmol-3 gives charges that correlate well with the reference charge.

From these experiments, in combination with AFM and ESEM imaging, it was concluded that the PEC adsorption stopped before full surface coverage was reached. Tensile testing of handsheets treated with PECs and PEM showed a significant increase in both tensile index and strain-at-break using both systems. The largest strength improvement was achieved with the fibres treated with the largest number of PEMs, but the largest effect per adsorbed amount of polymer was achieved by PEC treatment.']\n",

The Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) was used to gain information about the extended and compressed structure of adsorbed \"as received\" BSM, purified BSM, BSA extracted from the \"as received\" BSM and mixtures of the latter Purified proteins. The adsorbed amount was estimated using a combination of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA), Enzyme-Linked Lectin Assay (ELLA), Dual Polarization Interferometry (DPI) and Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM-D) measurements. Under the used conditions, purified BSM showed very low affinity for silica and only small amounts were found to adsorb on mica. Initially, the BSM molecules adopted an extended conformation on the mica surface with tails extending into the bulk phase. These tails were irreversibly compressed into a very thin (10 A) layer upon applying a high load. \"As received\" BSM formed considerably thicker Compressed layers (35 A); however, the extended layer structure was qualitatively the same. When Mixtures of purified BSM and BSA were coadsorbed on mica, a 9 wt-% albumin content gave a comparable layer thickness as the \"as received\" BSM and from XPS data we draw the conclusion that the albumin content in the layer adsorbed from \"as received\" BSM was approximately 5 wt-%. Adsorption from an equal amount of BSM and BSA revealed that even though the amount of BSM is scarce in the mixed layer, the few BSM molecules have a drastic effect on the adsorbed thickness and Structure. Clearly, this study shows the importance of characterizing the mucin used since differences in purity give rise to different adsorption behaviours in terms of both adsorbed amount and layer Structure.']\n",

The surface morphology and thickness of the cellulose  films were characterized in detail by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and  ellipsometry measurements, respectively. To determine the surface energy  of the cellulose surfaces, that Is, their ability to engage in  different interactions with different materials, they were characterized  through contact angle measurements against water, glycerol, and  methylene iodide.

The physical mixtures of all combinations of drug and polymer presented surface hydrophobicities, as measured by the equilibrium advancing contact angle of water, which are expected for materials that do not influence the interactions of each other with water. However, the solid dispersions containing HPMC deviated from this regular behaviour and displayed contact angles below those of the pure compounds involved, either drug or polymer.

All investigated dyes show slightly higher triplet rates at the dielectric interface compared to bulk solution measurements. We attribute this enhancement to possible modifications of the dyes-™ photophysical properties near a dielectric interface. In the case of rhodamine 6G, the impact of changes in the dye concentration, ionic strength of the solvent, and potassium iodide concentration are also investigated. This leads to a better understanding of the influences of dyeˆ’dye, dyeˆ’solvent, and dyeˆ’surface interactions on the increased triplet intersystem crossing and triplet decay rates. The study shows that analysis of triplet-state kinetics by TIR-FCS not only results in a better understanding of how the photophysical properties of the dyes are affected by the presence of an interface, but also provides a means for probing the microenvironment near dielectric interfaces.']\n",

Comparing substorm onset (auroral breakup) with GOES data and AE and PC indices, it is found that an exact onset determination from these parameters is in most cases not possible. The three weakest substorms leave no clear signatures in the auxiliary parameters. For the other events, the AE increase appears with a time delay of 5-15 min after onset. The PC indices increase, as expected, before the AE index. The time span between PC increase and onset varies widely (-26 to 5 min). A tail dipolarization is seen in GOES data with a time delay of 2-31 min after onset. The dipolarization delay at geosynchronous orbit appears because of the GOES displacement from the tail onset region. Using the mapped GOES distance from the auroral breakup region as an estimate of GOES displacement from the breakup source region, we find that the tail dipolarization region expands in average with an azimuthal speed of 0.22 MLT min(-1) and an equatorward speed of 0.09 degrees min(-1). Pseudobreakups leave hardly any signature in AE or PC index data except in the four strongest substorm cases. In these cases, a bump appears in the PC indices during the pseudobreakup.

The solitary structure propagates sunward with about 5 similar to 10 km/s carrying sunward electric field (in the propagation direction) of up to about 10 mV/m (total potential drop of about 5 similar to 10 kV), depletion of magnetic field of about 25%, and a duskward E x B convection up to 50 km/s of He+ rich cold plasma without O+. At the same time, auroral images from the IMAGE satellite together with ground based geomagnetic field data showed a westward (sunward at this location) propagating auroral bulge at the magnetically conjugate ionosphere with the solitary structure. The solitary structure is maintained by flux enhancement of selectively 3000 km/s ions (about 50 keV for H+, 200 keV for He+, and 750 keV for O+). These ions are the main carrier of the diamagnetic current causing the magnetic depletion, whereas the polarization is maintained by different behavior of energetic ions and electrons. Corresponding to aurora, field-aligned accelerated ionospheric plasma of several keV appeared at Cluster from both hemispheres simultaneously. Together with good correspondence in location and propagation velocity between the auroral bulge and the solitary structure, this indicates that the sunward moving auroral bulge is caused by the sunward propagation of the solitary structure which is maintained by energetic ions. The solitary structure might also be the cause of Pi2-like magnetic variation that started simultaneously at Cluster location.']\n",

Field-aligned ducts of enhanced plasma density guide the propagation from one hemisphere to the other. The location of the duct, relative to the strike that causes the whistler, is unknown. Whistler time series from Tihany, Hungary, have been cross-correlated with lightning data obtained from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). The results show that whistlers observed at Tihany originate mainly from lightning strikes in an area with a radius of approximately 1 000 km surrounding the magnetic conjugate point in the Indian Ocean just east of East London, South Africa. A clear diurnal distinction was seen in that the correlation is maximised when the whistler station and the source region are in darkness.

We focus on the remaining 14 of these events where the particle signatures show multiple distinct thin arcs. These events occur during northward or weakly southward IMF conditions and follow a change in IMF B-y. Correlations are seen between the field-aligned currents and plasma flows associated with the arcs, implying local closure of the FACs. Strong correlations are seen only in the sunlit hemisphere. The convection associated with the multiple thin arcs is localized and has little influence on the large-scale convection.

The role of plasmoid width and cross sectional shape in penetration is studied, and for plasmoids that are less than half an ion gyroradius wide, the plasmoid is compressed to obtain a vertically oriented elliptical cross section, regardless of the initial shape.

For both, large collapses, following long quiescent periods, have detrimental effects while short periods are associated with decreased confinement. Following the installation of the all metal -™ITER like wall-™ on JET, sawteeth and ELMs also play an important role by expelling tungsten from the core and edge of the plasma respectively. Control of tungsten has therefore been added to divertor heat load reduction, NTM avoidance and helium ash removal as reasons for requiring ELM and sawtooth control. It is therefore of interest to implement control systems to maintain the sawtooth and ELM frequencies in the desired ranges. On JET, ELM frequency control uses radial field -™kicks-™ and pellet and gas injection as actuators, while sawtooth control uses ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH). JET experiments have, for the first time, established feedback control of the ELM frequency, via real time variation of the injected gas flow [1]. Using this controller in conjunction with pellet injection allows the ELM frequency to be kept as required despite variations in pellet ELM triggering efficiency. JET Sawtooth control experiments have, for the first time, demonstrated that low field side ICRH, as foreseen for ITER, can shorten sawteeth lengthened by central fast ions [2]. The development of ELM and sawtooth control could be key to achieve stable high performance JET discharges with minimal tungsten content.

While D2D connectivity originally emerged as a technology enabler for public safety services, it is likely to remain at the heart of the 5G ecosystem by spawning a wide diversity of proximate applications and services. In this work, we argue that the widespread adoption of the direct communications paradigm is unlikely without embracing the concepts of trust and social-aware cooperation between end users and network operators. However, such adoption remains conditional on identifying adequate incentives that engage humans and their connected devices in a plethora of collective activities. To this end, the mission of our research is to advance the vision of social-aware and trusted D2D connectivity, as well as to facilitate its further adoption.

Our supportive system-level performance evaluations suggest that trusted and social-aware direct connectivity has the potential to decisively augment network performance.

      "['A model for the enhanced water dissociation that takes place at the solution/membrane interface in electromembrane processes is presented. The mechanisms behind the enhanced water dissociation are poorly understood and therefore a semi-empirical approach is suggested. The enhanced water dissociation is introduced as a heterogeneous surface reaction similar to the well established Butler-“Volmer law for electrode reactions. In the model there are two parameters that need to be determined through experiments. A 1D diffusion boundary layer problem is presented and solved in order to show that a sufficient rate of water dissociation can be obtained with the model. The advantage of the presented model is that it can easily be incorporated into simulations of electromembrane processes such as electrodialysis, electrodeionization and electropermutation. The influence of the enhanced water dissociation on these processes can then be studied.']\n",

      "['In this paper we present flow and travel time ensemble statistics based on a new simulation methodology, the adaptive Fup Monte Carlo method (AFMCM). As a benchmark case, we considered two-dimensional steady flow in a rectangular domain characterized by multi-Gaussian heterogeneity structure with an isotropic exponential correlation and lnK variance sigma(2)(Y) up to 8. Advective transport is investigated using the travel time framework where Lagrangian variables (e. g., velocity, transverse displacement, or travel time) depend on space rather than on time. We find that Eulerian and Lagrangian velocity distributions diverge for increasing lnK variance due to enhanced channeling. Transverse displacement is a nonnormal for all sigma(2)(Y) and control planes close to the injection area, but after xI(Y) = 20 was found to be nearly normal even for high sigma(2)(Y). Travel time distribution deviates from the Fickian model for large lnK variance and exhibits increasing skewness and a power law tail for large lnK variance, the slope of which decreases for increasing distance from the source; no anomalous features are found. Second moment of advective transport is analyzed with respect to the covariance of two Lagrangian velocity variables: slowness and slope which are directly related to the travel time and transverse displacement variance, which are subsequently related to the longitudinal and transverse dispersion. We provide simple estimators for the Eulerian velocity variance, travel time variance, slowness, and longitudinal dispersivity as a practical contribution of this analysis. Both two-parameter models considered (the advection-dispersion equation and the lognormal model) provide relatively poor representations of the initial part of the travel time probability density function in highly heterogeneous porous media. We identify the need for further theoretical and experimental scrutiny of early arrival times, and the need for computing higher-order moments for a more accurate characterization of the travel time probability density function. A brief discussion is presented on the challenges and extensions for which AFMCM is suggested as a suitable approach.']\n",

We find that the injection mode has a significant effect on dispersion: The resident injection mode exhibits anomalous features of transport whereas the flux injection mode tends to Gaussian transport; this observation is easily understood by considering phase diagrams where a limited number of particles entering low velocity fractures greatly increase macrodispersion. In spite of a sizeable portion of negative longitudinal velocities, it is shown that multiple crossings are negligible when quantifying longitudinal macrodispersion.

      "[\"The objective of this paper is to present the development of an effective thermal conductivity model for simulation of thermo-hydro-mechanical processes of geological porous media. The Wiener bounds and Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for thermal conductivity of three-phase mixture are introduced first, followed by descriptions of thermal conductivities of gas, water and solid, respectively. The derivation of a new effective thermal conductivity model, in closed form, is then presented. The model considers the combined effects of solid mineral composition, temperature, liquid saturation degree, porosity and pressure on the effective thermal conductivity of porous media, when multiphase flow with phase change is involved. The model strictly obeys the Wiener bounds (for anisotropic media) and Hashin-Shtrikman bounds (for isotropic media) over wide ranges of porosities and saturations, and the predicted results agrees very well with the experimental data for MX80 bentonite, compared with Johansen's method. An experimental benchmark test problem under laboratory conditions for coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical processes of compacted FEBEX bentonite is simulated for validation of the model, and the results show that the model provides improved predictions of the evolution and distribution of temperature, with simpler forms of mathematical functions.

      "['Permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel in crystalline bedrock is investigated in several countries. For this storage scenario, the host rock is the third and final barrier for radionuclide migration. Sorption reactions in the crystalline rock matrix have strong retardative effects on the transport of radionuclides. To assess the barrier properties of the host rock it is important to have sorption data representative of the undisturbed host rock conditions. Sorption data is in the majority of reported cases determined using crushed rock. Crushing has been shown to increase a rock samples sorption capacity by creating additional surfaces. There are several problems with such an extrapolation. In studies where this problem is addressed, simple models relating the specific surface area to the particle size are used to extrapolate experimental data to a value representative of the host rock conditions. In this article, we report and compare surface area data of five size fractions of crushed granite and of 100 mm long drillcores as determined by the Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET)-method using N-2-gas. Special sample holders that could hold large specimen were developed for the BET measurements. Surface area data on rock samples as large as the drillcore has not previously been published. An analysis of this data show that the extrapolated value for intact rock obtained from measurements on crushed material was larger than the determined specific surface area of the drillcores, in some cases with more than 1000%. Our results show that the use of data from crushed material and current models to extrapolate specific surface areas for host rock conditions can lead to over estimation interpretations of sorption ability. The shortcomings of the extrapolation model are discussed and possible explanations for the deviation from experimental data are proposed.']\n",

The distributions of fracture aperture and its evolution during shearing were calculated from the initial aperture, based on the laser-scanned sample surface roughness results, and shear dilations measured in the laboratory tests. Three normal loading conditions were adopted in the tests: simple normal stress and mixed normal stress and normal stiffness to reflect more realistic in situ conditions. A special algorithm for treatment of the contact areas as zero-aperture elements was used to produce more accurate flow field simulations, which is important for continued simulations of particle transport but often not properly treated in literature. The simulation results agree well with the measured hydraulic apertures and flow rate data obtained from the laboratory tests, showing that complex histories of fracture aperture and tortuous flow fields with changing normal loading conditions and increasing shear displacements. With the new algorithm for contact areas, the tortuous flow fields and channeling effects under normal stress/stiffness conditions during shearing were more realistically captured, which is not possible if traditional techniques by assuming very small aperture values for the contact areas were used. These findings have an important impact on the interpretation of the results of coupled hydro-mechanical experiments of rock fractures, and on more realistic simulations of particle transport processes in fractured rocks.']\n",

In the event of water-bearing fractures making contact with the bentonite barrier, generation and transport of colloidal particles will strongly depend on groundwater composition and the surface properties of the colloidal particles. The bentonite barrier will unavoidably be exposed to ionizing radiation from the spent nuclear fuel but very little is known about effects of ionizing radiation on bentonite concerning colloidal stability. In this work we have studied the effect of gamma-radiation on the stability of dilute colloidal Na+-montmorillonite dispersions using a Cs-137 gamma-source (doses of 0-53.2 kGy). Aggregation kinetics and sedimentation experiments revealed significant radiation effects, evident as increased colloid stability. The only rationale for this is a gamma-radiation induced increase in surface potential. The effects appeared to depend on the Na+-montmorillonite concentration in the irradiated dispersions, indicating that the change in surface potential is induced by aqueous radiolysis products.']\n",

The objectives of these experiments were to quantify, the sorption of different actinide elements in single fractures of a granite host rock and to investigate the sorption mechanisms. To guarantee the most realistic conditions-as close to nature as possible-in situ experiments were performed in the Chemlab 2 borehole probe. These migration experiments were complemented by laboratory sorption and migration studies. The latter included batch experiments with flat chips of natural material extracted from fracture surfaces to identify the mineral phases relevant to radionuclide sorption by means of autoradiography. Scanning electron microscopy analyses provided information on the composition of sorption-relevant phases and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Np, Tc, and Fe distribution revealed the redox states of these elements. Important mineral phases retaining all actinides and Tc were Fe-bearing phases. From the migration experiments, elution curves of the inert tracer (HTO), Np(V), U(VI), and to a small extent of Tc(VII) were obtained. Americium (III) and plutonium(IV) were not eluted. The mechanisms influencing the migration of the elements Np, U, and Tc depended on redox reactions. It was shown by various independent methods that Np(V) was reduced to the tetravalent state on the fracture surfaces, thus resulting in a pronounced dependence of the recovery on the residence time. Technetium was also retained in the tetravalent state. Elution of natural uranium from the granite drill cores was significant and is discussed in detail.']\n",

The current approach utilises expectation maximisation classification and skull stripping. The whole process from geometry extraction to model generation is converted into an automatic scheme. The models that are generated from the proposed method are validated in terms of segmentation accuracy, element quality and injury-prediction ability. The segmentations of the white matter and grey matter are about 90% accurate and the models have good element quality, with 94% of the elements having a Jacobian above 0.5. Using the experimental data from post-mortem human subject heads, nodal displacements were compared with the data collected from the simulations with the FE head models. The results are promising, indicating that the proposed method is good enough to generate patient-specific model for brain injury prediction. Further improvement can be made in terms of geometry accuracy and element quality.']\n",

Despite recent advances such as drug eluting stents, clinical studies suggest that stent design is linked to vascular injury. Additionally, dilation of the medical devices may trigger pathological responses such as growth and migration of vascular smooth cells, and may be a potent stimulus for neointimal hyperplasia. The purpose of this study is to experimentally investigate the mechanical characteristics of the transient expansion of six commercially available balloon-expandable stent systems, and to develop a robust finite element model based on the obtained experimental results. To reproduce the inflation of stent systems as in clinical practice, a pneumatic-hydraulic experimental setup is built, able to record loads and deformations. Characteristic pressure-diameter diagrams for the balloon-expandable stents and the detached balloons are experimentally obtained. Additionally, typical measures such as the burst opening pressure, the maximum dog-boning and foreshortening, and the elastic recoil are determined. The adopted constitutive models account for elastoplastic deformation of the stent, and for the nonlinear and anisotropic behavior of the balloon. The employed contact algorithm, based on a C (2)-continuous surface parametrization, efficiently simulates the interaction of the balloon and stent. The computational model is able to successfully capture the experimentally observed deformation mechanisms. Overall, the numerical results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data.']\n",

A model for saccular cerebral aneurysm growth by collagen fibre remodelling. J. Theor. Biol. 247, 775-787]. The continuous turnover of collagen is taken to be the driving mechanism in aneurysmal growth. The collagen production rate depends on the magnitude of the cyclic deformation of fibroblasts, caused by the pulsating blood pressure during the cardiac cycle. The volume density of fibroblasts in the aneurysmal tissue is taken to be constant throughout the growth process. The growth model is assessed by considering the inflation of an axisymmetric membranous piece of aneurysmal tissue, with material characteristics representative of a cerebral aneurysm. The diastolic and systolic states of the aneurysm are computed, together with its load-free state. It turns out that the value of collagen pre-stretch, that determines growth speed and stability of the aneurysm, is of pivotal importance. The model is able to predict aneurysms with typical berry-like shapes observed clinically, and the predicted wall stresses correlate well with the experimentally obtained ultimate stresses of this type of tissue. The model predicts that aneurysms should fail when reaching a size of about 1.2-3.6 mm, which is smaller than what has been clinically observed. With some refinements, the model may, however, be used to predict future growth of diagnosed aneurysms.']\n",

Recent developments of experimental micro-characterisation techniques have delivered further insight into the appearance and the behaviour of wood at smaller length scales. The improved knowledge and the availability of increasingly powerful micromechanical modelling techniques and homogenisation methods have stimulated rather comprehensive research on multiscale modelling of wood. Linking microstructural properties to macroscopic characteristics is expected to improve the knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of wood and to serve as the basis for the development of innovative wood-based products and for biomimetic material design. Moreover, understanding fundamental aspects of wood machining requires multiscale approaches which can take into account the heterogeneity, anisotropy and hierarchies of wood and wood composites. In this review, recent developments in the field of hierarchical modelling of the hygroelastic behaviour of wood are discussed, and a short outline of the theoretical background is given. Much focus is placed on composite micromechanical models for the wood cell wall and on multiscale models for wood resting upon hierarchical finite element models and on the application of continuum micromechanics, respectively. These models generally lead to the specification of equivalent homogeneous continua with effective material properties. Finally, current deficiencies and limitations of hierarchical models are sketched and possible future research directions are specified.']\n",

A strain energy function for arteries accounting for wall composition and structure. J. Biomech. 37, 989-1000] propose Psi = c(I-1 - 3)(3/2).

For case (i) we illustrate the functional relationships between: (a) the Cauchy stress (CS) and the Green-Lagrange (GL) strain; (b) the tangent modulus (gradient of the CS-GL strain curve) and linearised strain. The predicted mechanical responses are compared with recent uniaxial extension tests on elastin [Gundiah, N., Ratcliffe, M.B., Pruitt, L.A., 2007.

The neo-Hookean model accurately predicts the mechanical response of a single elastin fibre. However, it is unable to accurately capture the mechanical response of arterial elastin, e.g. the initial toe region of arterial elastin (if it exists) or the gradual increase in modulus of arterial elastin that occurs as it is stretched. The alternative constitutive model (n = 1) yields a nonlinear mechanical response that departs from recent uniaxial test data mentioned above, for the same stretch range. For case (ii) we illustrate the pressure-circumferential stretch relationships and the gradients of the pressure-circumferential stretch curves: significant qualitative differences are observed. For the neo-Hookean model, the gradient decreases rapidly to zero, however, for n = 3 the gradient decreases more gradually to a constant value.

The muscles were pre-stimulated at a fixed length, then different stretch/shortening episodes were introduced, whereafter changes of the active force were recorded while the muscles were held isometrically to approach a steady-state force before de-stimulation. The mechanical work during active stretch and shortening was evaluated by integrating the product of force and ramp velocity over the length-varying period. The results show a negative linear correlation between the force modification and the mechanical work produced on or by the muscle, continuous between shortening and stretch.

The model predicts a sign change for the magnetic ordering energy of mixing rather than the enthalpy of mixing in the bcc phase at 0 K. Designed key experiments are performed not only to check the validity of the present modeling but also to assist in understanding the mechanism for spinodal decomposition of the Fe-Cr alloy. Heat capacities and Curie temperatures of several Fe-rich alloys are determined between 320 and 1093 K by employing differential scanning calorimetry. The measured heat capacities are found to be in remarkable agreement with the prediction based on the present modeling. Microstructural patterns and frequency distribution diagrams of Cr are studied in alloys containing 26.65, 31.95, and 37.76 at.% Cr by using atom probe tomography. The observed phase separation results correspond well with our model-predicted boundary for the spinodal decomposition.

The experimental results are compared with results of first-principles calculations of the mixing and solubility energies for Ga in an Fe-X (X = Co, Cr) alloy both in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states. It is shown that Ga mainly goes into the solid solutions of the base alloys. In the alloys of the Fe-Cr system, doping with Ga handicaps the decomposition of solid solutions, observed in the binary alloys, and increases its stability. In the alloys with Co, Ga also favors the uniformity of solid solutions. The results of the first-principles calculations testify in favor of a preferable dissolution of Ga in the FeCo regions of a multicomponent structure rather than FeCr regions, both types of regions being in the ferromagnetic state at the temperature of annealing. The analysis of Mossbauer experiments gives some grounds to conclude that if, owing to liquation, clusterization, or initial stages of phase separation, there exist regions enriched in iron, some amount of Ga atoms prefer to enter the nearest surroundings of iron atoms, thus forming binary Fe-Ga regions (or phases).']\n",

In cyclohexane, normal forces of 200-500 pN and energies of 43.5 +/- 6.0 kJ/mol glucose unit were required to pull off the octamer. The normal forces in water were substantially lower, around 58 pN, and the energies were 18.2 +/- 3.6 kJ/mol glucose unit.

It can, however, also be estimated from a kinetic point of view by studying the process of colloidal coagulation, or from a dynamic point of view by considering colloidal transport in nonequilibrium systems where other processes such as diffusion and the influence of gravity come into play. In particular, in a test tube where colloidal expansion takes place, the ccc can be interpreted as the electrolyte concentration below which expansion of colloids would always lead to full access to the entire volume of the test tube and above which a sharp boundary is established between a colloidal gel and pure water. On the basis of this perception and the dynamic force balance model that we developed to describe colloidal expansion in a test tube, accounting for the effects of particle diffusion and gravity in contrast to the DLVO theory, we propose an alternative way to assess the ccc of counterions. We also derive an approximate expression for the case of homointeraction at constant charge for montmorillonite. The estimated ccc values agree quite well with those observed experimentally for both Na+ and Ca2+ counterions for montmorillonite dispersions, at pH similar to 6.5. This is in contrast to the DLVO theory, which overpredicts the ccc by about 2 orders of magnitude. In addition, the detailed analyses suggest that the ccc of counterions decreases with increasing surface area and with the thickness of the particles. For montmorillonite, the ccc is nearly independent of the surface charge density of the particles for the range of typical charge densities.']\n",

In order to achieve this goal a \"divide and conquer\" approach is proposed. Different agents focus on different objectives that are pursued in parallel. Agents adopt different behaviors depending on the status of the environment and their interaction with other agents. Agents are cooperative by default as they try to meet their spec without making changes that affect other agents. However, more aggressive behaviors that lead to global changes can be adopted when needed. The interaction between these simple entities yields an emergent behavior able to deal smoothly with the complexity of the problem at hand.']\n",

Existing electronic noses still do not have the necessary sensitivity and accuracy. By modeling a cell\\'s chemical detection system, we can gain insight into the basic \"olfactory\" system. We use an inspiration from chemotaxis and Hebbian learning to enhance localization and tracking of gradient sources, which can be applied to both chemicals and heat. The eukaryotic receptor clustering model shows improvement over previous prokaryotic chemotaxis-inspired methods that do not take into account receptor clustering. Receptor clustering essentially adapts receptors spatio-temporally. For a mobile simulation. our method locates the source in less convergence time than the other chemotaxis algorithms and insignificantly less time compared to no spatio-temporal filtering (e.g. a single-sensor memoryless case). We then show that local regions of receptor cooperation have the best performance reflecting observations of receptor behavior in biology. To demonstrate the performance of this system in real-time, a stationary 4/8-sensor version of the array is implemented, and the algorithm improves the convergence time, mean, and variance of the Direction-of-Arrival calculation in diffusive, turbulent, and noisy environments.']\n",

Our aim is twofold: to evaluate the potential of such mechanisms in network multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, and to develop scalable numerical schemes that allow real-time near-optimal resource allocation across multiple sites. We formulate two versions of the SINR target and power allocation problem: one for maximizing the sum rate subject to power constraints, and one for minimizing the total power needed to meet a sum-rate target. To evaluate the potential of our approach, we perform a semianalytical study in Mathematica using the augmented Lagrangian penalty function method. We find that the gain of the joint optimum SINR setting and power allocation may be significant depending on the degree of fairness that we impose. We develop a numerical technique, based on successive convexification, for real-time optimization of SINR targets and transmit powers. We benchmark our procedure against the globally optimal solution and demonstrate consistently strong performance in realistic network MIMO scenarios. Finally, we study the impact of near optimal precoding in a multicell MIMO environment and find that precoding helps to reduce the sum transmit power while meeting a capacity target.']\n",

The search space is divided into several segments like the net of a spider. The social information sharing among the swarms are made strong and adaptive. The main focus is on the fitness of the swarms adjusting to the learning factors of the PSO. The traditional Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms converges rapidly during the initial stage of a search, but in course of time becomes steady considerably and can get trapped in a local optima. On the other hand in the proposed model the swarms are provided with the intelligence of a spider which enables them to avoid premature convergence and also help them to escape from local optima. The proposed approaches have been validated using a series of benchmark test functions with high dimensions. Comparative analysis with the traditional PSO algorithm suggests that the new algorithm significantly improves the performance when dealing with multimodal functions.']\n",

A practical solution to the problem is to aggregate the bandwidth of 802.11 access points (APs) backhauls in range. Since 802.11 devices are usually single radio, the communication to APs on different radio channels requires a time-division multiple access (TDMA) policy at the client station. With an in-depth experimental analysis and a customized 802.11 driver, in this paper, we show that the usage of multi-AP TDMA policy may cause degradation of the TCP throughput and an underutilization of the AP backhauls.

      "['The high interest in applications of conducting polymers, especially polyaniline (PANI), makes it important to overcome limitations for effective usage due to poor processability and solubility. One promising approach is to make blends of PANT in polymeric resins. However, in this approach other problems related to the difficulty of achieving a homogeneous PANI dispersion arise. The present article is focused on this general problem, and we discuss how the synthesis method, choice of dopant and solvent as well as interfacial energies influence the dispersibility. For this purpose, different synthesis methods and dopants have been employed to prepare nanostructures of polyaniline. Dynamic light scattering analysis of dispersions of the synthesized particles in several solvents was employed in order to understand how the choice of solvent affects PANT aggregation. Further information on this subject was achieved by scanning electron microscopy studies of PANT powders dried from various solutions. On the basis of these results, acetone was found to be a suitable dispersion medium for PANI. The polymer matrix used to make the blends in this work is a UV-curing solvent-free resin. Therefore, there is no low molecular weight liquid in the system to facilitate the mixing process and promote formation of homogeneous dispersions. Thus, a good compatibility of the components becomes crucial. For this reason, surface tension and contact angle measurements were utilized for characterizing the surface energy of the PANI particles and the polyester acrylate (PEA) resin, and also for calculating the interfacial energy between these two components that revealed good compatibility within the PANI/PEA blend. A novel technique, based on centrifugal sedimentation analysis, was employed in order to determine the PANT particle size in PEA resin, and high dispersion stability of the PANI/PEA blends was suggested by evaluation of the sedimentation data.']\n",

In the theoretical framework, business-service firms have random-choice preferences and respond in a non-linear way to time distances in their contact efforts to customer firms. Business-service firms make their location decisions in response to local, intra-regional and extra-regional access to market demand. The econometric analysis makes use of information about time distances between zones in urban areas as well as between urban areas in the same agglomeration and between urban areas in different agglomerations.

In particular a lot of attention has been directed towards its high pressure behavior, where an isostructural volume collapse (gamma phase -&gt; alpha phase) has been observed.

However, over the years it has been repeatedly questioned whether the cerium collapse really is isostructural. Most recently, detailed experiments have been able to remove this worrisome uncertainty. Therefore the isostructural aspect of the a-c transition has now to be seriously addressed in the theoretical modeling, something which has been very much neglected.

The theoretical and computational description of this binding (as well as that of other transition metals) is a challenging task. In this paper the binding of the Zn ion to four cysteine residues in the structural site of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) is studied using a synthetic peptide mimic of this site. The study includes experimental measurements of binding constants, classical free energy calculations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanical (QM) electron structure calculations. The classical MD results account for interactions at the molecular level and reproduce the absolute binding energy and the hydration free energy of the Zn ion with an accuracy of about 10%. This is insufficient to obtain correct free energy differences. QM correction terms were calculated from density functional theory (DFT) on small clusters of atoms to include electronic polarisation of the closest waters and covalent contributions to the Zn-S coordination bond. This results in reasonably good agreement with the experimentally measured binding constants and Zn ion hydration free energies in agreement with published experimental values. The study also includes the replacement of one cysteine residue to an alanine. Simulations as well as experiments showed only a small effect of this upon the binding free energy.

The improved resolution shows that the Rayleigh line is narrower than in earlier studies, which corresponds to a smaller thermal diffusivity. From a detailed analysis of the power spectrum, we can, in fact, distinguish two dispersive contributions to the elastic scattering. These translate to two exponential relaxation processes in separate time domains. Further, by including a first correction to the wave-vector-dependent position of the Brillouin lines, the results agree favorably to generalized hydrodynamics even up to intermediate wave vectors, and also yields a 20% higher adiabatic sound velocity.

We find that in both the solvents the adenosine molecule can remain either in anti or syn conformations.

A laboratory Hartmann-Shack sensor was used to assess the aberrations in 0 degrees, 20 degrees, and 30 degrees in the nasal visual field of 43 normal eyes. The elliptical pupil meant that the quantification could be done in different ways. The three approaches used were (1) over a circular aperture encircling the pupil, (2) over a stretched version of the elliptical pupil, and (3) over a circular aperture within the pupil (MATLAB conversion code given). Astigmatism (c(2)(2)) increased quadratically and coma (c(3)(1)) linearly with the horizontal viewing angle, whereas spherical aberration (c(4)(0)) decreased slightly toward the periphery. There was no correlation between defocus and angle, although some trends were found when the subjects were divided into groups depending on refractive error. When comparing results of different studies it has to be kept in mind that the coefficients differ depending on how the elliptical pupil is taken into consideration.']\n",

All activities (eating, drinking, hygiene, etc.) were conducted in the horizontal position. On the 1st and 22nd day of bed rest, cutaneous temperature sensitivity was tested by applying cold and warm stimuli of different magnitudes to the volar region of the forearm via a Peltier element thermode. Behavioural thermoregulation was assessed by having the subjects regulate the temperature of the water within a water-perfused suit (T (wps)) they were wearing. A control unit established a sinusoidal change in T (wps), such that it varied from 27 to 42A degrees C. The subjects could alter the direction of the change of T (wps), when they perceived it as thermally uncomfortable. The magnitude of the oscillations towards the end of the trial was assumed to represent the upper and lower boundaries of the thermal comfort zone. The cutaneous threshold for detecting cold stimulus decreased (P &lt; 0.05) from 1.6 (1.0)A degrees C on day 1 to 1.0 (0.3)A degrees C on day 22. No effect was observed on the ability to detect warm stimuli or on the regulated T (wps).

      "['PURPOSE. Peripheral optical corrections are often thought to give few visual benefits beyond improved detection acuity. However, patients with central visual field loss seem to benefit from peripheral correction, and animal studies suggest a role for peripheral vision in the development of myopia. This study was conducted to bridge this gap by systematically studying the sensitivity to optical defocus in a wide range of peripheral visual tasks. METHODS. The spatial frequency threshold for detection and resolution in high and low contrast with stationary and drifting gratings were measured off-axis (20 nasal visual field) in five subjects with a peripheral optical correction that was varied systematically +/- 4 D. RESULTS. All visual tasks, except high-contrast resolution, were sensitive to optical defocus, particularly low-contrast resolution with an increase of up to 0.227 logMAR/D. The two myopic subjects exhibited a very low sensitivity to defocus by negative lenses for low-contrast tasks, whereas all subjects were equally affected by myopic defocus. Contrary to expectations, drifting gratings made little difference overall. CONCLUSIONS. Optical defocus as low as 1 D has a large impact on most peripheral visual tasks, with high-contrast resolution being the exception. Since the everyday visual scenery consists of objects at different contrast levels, it is understandable that persons with central visual field loss are helped by correction of peripheral refractive errors. The asymmetry in sensitivity to peripheral optical defocus in low-contrast tasks that was experienced by the myopic subjects in this study merits further investigation.']\n",

The deviation in distortion with respect to the given figure is represented in terms of percentage distortion. The influence of vibrations on the sketching activity was investigated both subjectively and by two specifically designed objective methods, namely, RMS (root mean square methodology) and area methods. The judgements of perceived difficulty to sketch were rated using seven-point semantic judgement scale. The percentage distortion and difficulty in sketching activity increased with an increase in vibration magnitude. Both subjective evaluation and the RMS method revealed that the task was affected more while sketching on the table. The percentage distortion was affected similarly and maximum in all the vibration directions except for the vertical, while sketching difficulty was found to be higher only with longitudinal and multi-axis vibration direction.

We have measured off-axis aberrations in the groups of 30 younger (24 +/- 3 years) and 30 older (58 +/- 5 years) emmetropes. The aberrations of OD were measured using the COAS-HD VR Shack-Hartmann aberrometer in 10 degrees steps to +/- 40 degrees horizontally and -20 degrees inferiorly in the visual field. The aberrations were quantified with Zernike polynomials for a 4 mm pupil diameter. The second-order aberration coefficients were converted to their respective refraction components (M, J(45), and J(180)). Mixed between-within subjects, analysis of variance were used to determine whether there were significant differences in the refraction and aberration components for the between-subjects variable age and the within-subjects variable eccentricity. Results. Peripheral refraction components were similar in both age groups. Among the higher order coefficients, horizontal coma (C(3)(1)) and spherical aberration (C(4)(0)) varied mostly between the groups. Coma increased linearly with eccentricity, at a more rapid rate in the older group than in the younger group. Spherical aberration was more positive in the older group compared with the younger group. Higher order root mean square increased more rapidly with eccentricity in the older group. Conclusions. Like the axial higher order aberrations, the peripheral higher order aberrations of emmetropes increase with age, particularly coma and spherical aberration.']\n",

At the fovea, an average longitudinal chromatic aberration of 1D between red (671 nm) and blue (473 nm) light was found, and it increased slightly with eccentricity (up to 1.2D). A similar trend was measured for astigmatism as a function of wavelength (increase similar to 0.15D). Computational ray tracing in model eyes showed that the origin of the small increase of chromatic aberrations with eccentricity is the change of the oblique power of the refractive surfaces in the eye. Factors related to increase of axial length and refractive index of the eye were found to have a very small influence.\"]\n",

The approach is comprised of solution chemical synthesis of a precursor and its thermochemical processing toward the desired phase. All the constituent elements, Ba, Sr, Co, and Fe, were coprecipitated from an aqueous solution of their salts to produce a precursor with a well-defined composition, fine particle size, high homogeneity, and high reactivity. After calcining and sintering at 1000 degrees C, the individual oxides were alloyed into nanostructured perovskite (with x=0.5 and y=0.2) Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 of high purity. Spark plasma sintering was used for compaction to preserve the material's nanostructure, and sintered compacts demonstrated a significant increase in electrical conductivity values at temperatures up to 900 degrees C, compared to the earlier reports. The measured conductivity values are sufficiently high for cathode applications with a maximum of about 63 S cm(-1) at 430 degrees C in air and 25 S cm(-1) at 375 degrees C in N-2, respectively. These values are about twice as high as conventional BSCF mainly due to the reduction in interfacial resistance, implying a high promise for nanoengineered BSCF as cathode material at low or intermediate-temperature SOFCs.\"]\n",

Such high temperature prevents SOFC technology from commercialization. Design and development of materials functioning at low temperatures are therefore a critical challenge.

Through a review of typical SOFC electrolyte materials and analysis of the ionic conduction theory as well as constrains and disadvantages in single-phase materials, the need for design, development and theory of new materials are obvious. Our approach is to design and develop two-phase materials and functionalities at interfaces between the constituent phases in nanotech-based composites, that is nanocomposites. The nano- and composite technologies can realize superionic conduction by constructing the interfaces as 'ion highways'. Manipulation of the interphases of the nanocomposites can overcome SOFC challenges and thus enhance and improve material conductivity and FC performance at significantly lower temperatures (300-600 degrees C).\"]\n",

Two different fracture criteria are adopted for the calculation of an equivalent stress intensity factor and crack deflection angle.

      "['A triangular grid single polarized tapered-slot array antenna for radar applications is studied. Compared with a rectangular grid an equilateral triangular grid allows a larger unit cell without any onset of grating lobes. Since single polarized tapered-slots in triangular grids support guided modes, which cause scan blindness, the increase in unit cell size is smaller than the optimal 15%. The design presented in the paper is capable of scan angles out to 60° from broadside in the E and H planes. To improve the match over the radar band a local minimum in the active reflection coefficient is positioned at the most critical scan direction, resulting in a reflection coefficient that is less than -12 dB in the X-band. To reduce the radar cross section for the cross-polarization an absorbing layer is positioned above the ground plane, which affects some of the guided modes that lead to scan blindnesses. An experimental antenna with 16Á—16 elements was built, and it was found that the H-plane performance for large scan angles for the finite antenna deviates more than expected from the infinite array approximation. Otherwise both mutual coupling measurements and embedded element patterns agrees well with the numerical results.']\n",

Although home ownership rates have been on the increase globally since the Second World War, recent signs indicate that this trend has been halted. However, it is argued that little is known on the actual effectiveness of most of the described policies and that a set of policies, focusing on at least the first three stages above, is needed should a government wish to encourage home ownership. Moreover, direct subsidies and grants are probably not very interesting considering the weak financial situation of most governments.

A boundary layer  of Falkner-“Skan-“Cooke type with favourable pressure gradient is  considered to model the flow slightly downstream of a swept-wing leading  edge. In this region, stationary and travelling crossflow instability  dominates over other instability types. Three scenarios are  investigated: the presence of low-amplitude chordwise localized,  spanwise periodic roughness elements on the plate, the impingement of a  weak vortical free-stream mode on the boundary layer and the combination  of both disturbance sources. Three receptivity mechanisms are  identified: steady receptivity to roughness, unsteady receptivity to  free-stream vorticity and unsteady receptivity to vortical modes  scattered at the roughness. Both roughness and vortical modes provide  efficient direct receptivity mechanisms for stationary and travelling  crossflow instabilities. We find that stationary crossflow modes  dominate for free-stream turbulence below a level of about 0.5%, whereas  higher turbulence levels will promote the unsteady receptivity  mechanism. Under the assumption of small amplitudes of the roughness and  the free-stream disturbance, the unsteady receptivity process due to  scattering of free-stream vorticity at the roughness has been found to  give small initial disturbance amplitudes in comparison to the direct  mechanism for free-stream modes. However, in many environments  free-stream vorticity and roughness may excite interacting unstable  stationary and travelling crossflow waves. This nonlinear process may  rapidly lead to large disturbance amplitudes and promote transition to  turbulence.']\n",

The methods are applied to the two-dimensional spatially developing Blasius boundary-layer. A critical step in the process of systematically investigating stability properties and designing feedback controllers is solving very large eigenvalue problems by storing only velocity fields at different times instead of large matrices. For stability analysis, where the entire dynamics of perturbations in space and time is of interest, iterative and adjoint-based optimization techniques are employed to compute the global eigenmodes and the optimal initial conditions. The latter are the initial conditions yielding the largest possible energy growth over a finite time interval. The leading global eigenmodes take the shape of Tollmien-Schlichting wavepackets located far downstream in streamwise direction, whereas the leading optimal disturbances are tilted structures located far upstream in the boundary layer. For control design on the other hand, the input-output behavior of the system is of interest and the snapshot-method is employed to compute balanced modes that correctly capture this behavior. The inputs are external disturbances and wall actuation and the outputs are sensors that extract wall shear stress. A low-dimensional model that capture the input-output behavior is constructed by projection onto balanced modes. The reduced-order model is then used to design a feedback control strategy such that the growth of disturbances are damped as they propagate downstream.']\n",

The vortices were generated by means of vortex generators (VGs) in different configurations. Both single pairs and arrays in a natural setting as well as in yaw have been considered. Moreover three different vortex blade heights h, with the spacing d and the distance to the neighbouring vortex pair D for the array con guration, were studied keeping the same d / h and D / h ratios. It is shown that the vortex core paths scale with h in the streamwise direction and with D and h in the spanwise and wall-normal directions, respectively. A new peculiar \"hooklike\" vortex core motion, seen in the cross-ow plane, has been identi ed in the far region, starting around 200h and 50h for the pair and the array con guration, respectively. This behaviour is explained in the paper. Furthermore the experimental data indicate that the vortex paths asymptote to a prescribed location in the cross-ow plane, which rst was stated as a hypothesis and later veri ed. This observation goes against previously reported numerical results based on inviscid theory. An account for the important viscous e ects is taken in a pseudo-viscous vortex model which is able to capture the streamwise core evolution throughout the measurement region down to 450h. Finally, the e ect of yawing is reported, and it is shown that spanwiseaveraged quantities such as the shape factor and the circulation are hardly perceptible. However, the evolution of the vortex cores are di erent both between the pair and the array con guration and in the natural setting versus the case with yaw.

      "[\"It is well known among geodesists that the gravitational effect of the topography must be removed (direct topographic effect) prior to geoid computation, for example, by Stokes' formula, and restored afterward (indirect topographic effect). The direct effect is usually decomposed into the effects of the Bouguer shell (-V-B) and the terrain. While the computation of V-B is a simple matter, the detailed consideration of the terrain effect is more difficult. This study emphasizes, that, in principle, the geoid height can be determined by the remove restore technique in considering only V-B and the effect of an arbitrarily small area of the terrain along the radius vector at the computation point, and that the determination of VB requires only the density distribution be known along this radius. The method is justified by the approximation theorems of Runge-Krarup and Keldysh-Lavrentieff. The answer to the headline question is therefore no. A closely related question is how to find a candidate method for the analytical continuation of the external potential. The paper studies whether a Taylor series can take on this role. It is concluded that this series will converge, if the direct effects of the Bouguer potential and the mass of the terrain in a near-zone around the computation point (P) are applied prior to downward continuation. The radius of the near-zone is shown not to exceed that of the height of any mountain around P, which, in the worst case (with P located near the top of Mt Everest) yields a radius of convergence within 9 km. In most cases the radius is much smaller. Hence, only a very local part of the terrain potential must be removed to allow the determination of the geoid height by Taylor expansion. Importantly, if the height of P is at least twice that of any point of the near-zone topography (e.g. for airborne and satellite gravity), the Taylor series always converges without any reduction for terrain.\"]\n",

Based on T and the gravity disturbance data, we directly downward continue T to the geoid, and we present the final solution for the geoid height, including topographic corrections. It can be proved that the Taylor expansion of T converges if the flight level is at least twice the height of the topography, and the terrain potential will not contribute to the topographic correction. Hence, the simple topographic bias of the Bouguer shell yields the only topographic correction.

Control measurements at the Hofn station showed a gravity decrease of -2 +/- A 0.5 A mu Gal/a relative to the station RVIK 5473 at Reykjavik (about 250 km from Hofn).

Although the derived gravity change rates at individual sites have large uncertainties, the ensemble of the rates varies systematically and significantly with distance from the ice.

First, the solution is derived for a constant topographic density, in which case the bias can be expressed by a very simple formula related with the topographic height above the computation point. Second, for an arbitrary density distribution the bias becomes an integral along the vertical from the computation point to the Earth's surface.

This paper overviews the concept, potential applications, experiments, results and a numerical model. The experimental work includes studying the flight of ink droplets, which ejected from an inkjet print head, fly through a free ink film, suspended in a frame and positioned in front of the printhead. We experimentally observed that the minimum velocity required for the 80 pl droplets to fly through the 75 Á‚± 24 lm thick ink film was of 6.6 m s-1. We also present a numerical simulation of the passage of liquid droplets through a liquid film. The numerical results for different initial speeds of droplets and their shapes are taken into account. We observed that during the droplet-film interaction, the surface energy is partially converted to kinetic energy, and this, together with the impact time, helps the droplets penetrate the film. The model includes the Navier- Stokes equations with continuum-surface-tension force derived from the phase-field/Cahn-Hilliard equation. This system allows us to simulate the motion of a free surface in the presence of surface tension during merging, mixing and ejection of droplets. The influence of dispensing conditions was studied and it was found that the residual velocity of droplets after their passage through the thin liquid film well matches the measured velocity from the experiment.']\n",

Since the electric- and magnetic-dipole allowed transitions of atoms can be excited by visible and infrared lightwaves, the refractive index of the atomic vapor can exhibit its negative refractive index at optical and near-optical frequency bands. This may be a new scheme to fabricate a negatively refracting material based on the quantum optical approach. Such a three-dimensionally isotropic negative refractive index at visible and infrared wavelengths induced by the two-photon-resonant quantum coherence would find a potential application in fabrication of superlenses for perfect imaging and subwavelength focusing.']\n",

      "['Objective: Tumours in the adrenocortex are common human tumours. Malignancy is however, rare, the yearly incidence being 0.5-2 per million inhabitants, but associated with a very aggressive behaviour. Adrenocortical tumours are often associated with altered hormone production with a variety of clinical symptoms. The aggressiveness of carcinomas together with the high frequency of adenomas calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and an improvement of the diagnostic possibilities. Methods: Microarray gene expression analysis was performed in tumours of adrenocortex with emphasis on malignancy as well as hormonal activity. The sample set consisted of 17 adenomas, 11 carcinomas and 4 histological normal adrenocortexes. RNA from these was hybridised according to a reference design on microarrays harbouring 29 760 human cDNA clones. Confirmation was performed with quantitative real time-PCR and western blot analysis. Results: Unsupervised clustering to reveal relationships between samples based on the entire gene expression profile resulted in two subclusters; carcinomas and non-cancer specimens. A large number of genes were accordingly found to be differentially expressed comparing carcinomas to adenomas. Among these were IGF2, FGFR1 and FGFR4 in growth factor signalling the most predominant and also the USP4, UBE2C and UFD1L in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, two subgroups of carcinomas were identified with different survival outcome, suggesting that survival prediction can be made on the basis of gene expression profiles. Regarding adenomas with aldosterone overproduction, OSBP and VEGFB were among the most up-regulated genes compared with the other samples. Conclusions: Adrenocortical carcinomas are associated with a distinct molecular signature apparent in their gene expression profiles. Differentially expressed genes were identified associated with malignancy, survival as well as hormonal activity providing a resource of candidate genes for an exploration of possible drug targets and diagnostic and prognostic markers.']\n",

Therefore, to assess degrees of this correlation we compared the RNA profiles (determined using both cDNA- and oligo-based microarrays) and protein profiles (determined immunohistochemically in tissue microarrays) of 1066 gene products in 23 human cell lines. Results: A high mean correlation coefficient (0.52) was obtained from the pairwise comparison of RNA levels determined by the two platforms. Significant correlations, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.445, between protein and RNA levels were also obtained for a third of the specific gene products. However, the correlation coefficients between levels of RNA and protein products of specific genes varied widely, and the mean correlations between the protein and corresponding RNA levels determined using the cDNA- and oligo-based microarrays were 0.25 and 0.20, respectively. Conclusion: Significant correlations were found in one third of the examined RNA species and corresponding proteins. These results suggest that RNA profiling might provide indirect support to antibodies-™ specificity, since whenever a evident correlation between the RNA and protein profiles exists, this can sustain that the antibodies used in the immunoassay recognized their cognate antigens.']\n",

Objective: To investigate reactivities of anti-CCP to various citrullinated proteins/peptides, which represent potential autoantigens in RA, and to examine the relationship between such antibodies, and their association with genetic variants within HLA-DRB1 SE alleles. Methods: Serum samples from 291 patients with established RA and 100 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects were included in this study. Sera were first analysed for presence of anti-CCP antibodies and further for IgG and IgA antibodies towards candidate autoantigens in both their native and citrullinated form including: fibrinogen, alpha-enolase peptide-1 and the C1-epitope of type II collagen (C1(III)). Antibody specificity was confirmed by cross-reactivity tests. HLA-DR genotyping was performed. Results: 72% of patients with RA were anti-CCP positive. Among the candidate autoantigens examined, IgG antibodies to citrullinated fibrinogen were found in 66% of patients' sera and in 41% for both citrullinated alpha-enolase peptide-1 and citrullinated C1(III). These antibodies were mainly seen in the anti-CCP-positive patient group; they were specific for their respective antigen and displayed limited cross reactivity. IgA responses were also detected, but less frequently than IgG. Anti-CCP and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies were associated with HLA-DRB1*04 rather than with HLA-DRB1*01 alleles. Conclusions: Antibodies directed against several citrullinated antigens are present in CCP-positive RA, with many patients displaying multireactivity. All specific reactivities were primarily associated with the HLA-DRB1*04 alleles, suggesting common pathways of anti-citrulline immunity.\"]\n",

For gene expression studies, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used, whereas monospecific polyclonal antibodies were generated and used to investigate protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Thirty-six transporters were studied for gene expression, and nine were studied for protein expression. The antibodies were validated using expression patterns in human tissues.

In general, the adherent cell lines (HeLa, HEK293) displayed low transporter expression, and the expression patterns were barely affected by transfection.

Comparison of gene and protein expression profiles gave poor correlations, but better agreement was obtained for antibodies with a good validation score, indicating that antibody quality was a significant variable. It is noteworthy that the monocarboxylic acid-transporting protein MCT1 was significantly expressed in all and was functional in most of the cell lines, indicating that MCT1 may be a confounding factor when the transport of small anionic drugs is investigated.']\n",

      "['Background: We recently demonstrated that increased expression of the RNA-binding protein RBM3 is associated with a favourable prognosis in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of RBM3 mRNA and protein expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and the cisplatin response upon RBM3 depletion in a cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cell line. Methods: RBM3 mRNA expression was analysed in tumors from a cohort of 267 EOC cases (Cohort I) and RBM3 protein expression was analysed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an independent cohort of 154 prospectively collected EOC cases (Cohort II). Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were applied to assess the relationship between RBM3 and recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Immunoblotting and IHC were used to examine the expression of RBM3 in a cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780-Cp70 and its cisplatin-responsive parental cell line A2780. The impact of RBM3 on cisplatin response in EOC was assessed using siRNA-mediated silencing of RBM3 in A2780 cells followed by cell viability assay and cell cycle analysis. Results: Increased RBM3 mRNA expression was associated with a prolonged RFS (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.47-0.86, p = 0.003) and OS (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44-0.95, p = 0.024) in Cohort I. Multivariate analysis confirmed that RBM3 mRNA expression was an independent predictor of a prolonged RFS, (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.44-0.84, p = 0.003) and OS (HR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.41-0.95; p = 0.028) in Cohort I. In Cohort II, RBM3 protein expression was associated with a prolonged OS (HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.35-0.79, p = 0.002) confirmed by multivariate analysis (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.40-0.92, p = 0.017). RBM3 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in the cisplatin sensitive A2780 cell line compared to the cisplatin resistant A2780-Cp70 derivative. siRNA-mediated silencing of RBM3 expression in the A2780 cells resulted in a decreased sensitivity to cisplatin as demonstrated by increased cell viability and reduced proportion of cells arrested in the G2/M-phase. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that RBM3 expression is associated with cisplatin sensitivity in vitro and with a good prognosis in EOC. Taken together these findings suggest that RBM3 may be a useful prognostic and treatment predictive marker in EOC.']\n",

      "['Background: Our group previously reported that tumour-specific expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) is associated with more favourable tumour parameters and a good prognosis in breast cancer. In the present study, the prognostic value of HMG-CoAR expression was examined in tumours from a cohort of patients with primary epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: HMG-CoAR expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays (TMA) consisting of 76 ovarian cancer cases, analysed using automated algorithms to develop a quantitative scoring model. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to estimate the risk of recurrence free survival (RFS). Results: Seventy-two tumours were suitable for analysis. Cytoplasmic HMG-CoAR expression was present in 65% (n = 46) of tumours. No relationship was seen between HMG-CoAR and age, histological subtype, grade, disease stage, estrogen receptor or Ki-67 status. Patients with tumours expressing HMG-CoAR had a significantly prolonged RFS (p = 0.012). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that HMG-CoAR expression was an independent predictor of improved RFS (RR = 0.49, 95% CI (0.25-0.93); p = 0.03) when adjusted for established prognostic factors such as residual disease, tumour stage and grade. Conclusion: HMG-CoAR expression is an independent predictor of prolonged RFS in primary ovarian cancer. As HMG-CoAR inhibitors, also known as statins, have demonstrated anti-neoplastic effects in vitro, further studies are required to evaluate HMG-CoAR expression as a surrogate marker of response to statin treatment, especially in conjunction with current chemotherapeutic regimens.']\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the protein expression pattern of SOX10 in malignant melanoma tumors and to analyze whether the results correlated with clinical parameters and the proliferation marker Ki-67. Furthermore, proliferation and migration were analyzed in three different cell lines employing SOX10 small interfering RNA-mediated silencing. Expression patterns were determined in 106 primary tumors and 39 metastases in addition to 16 normal skin samples and six benign nevi employing immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays. The immunohistochemical staining was evaluated manually and with an automated algorithm. SOX10 was strongly expressed in the benign tissues, but for the malignant tumors superficial spreading melanomas stained stronger than nodular malignant melanomas (P = 0.008). The staining intensity was also inversely correlated with T-stage (Spearman's rho = -0.261, P = 0.008). Overall survival and time to recurrence were significantly correlated with SOX10 intensity, but not in multivariate analysis including T-stage. With the automated algorithm there was an inverse correlation between the SOX10 staining intensity and the proliferation marker, Ki-67 (rho = -0.173, P = 0.02) and a significant difference in the intensity signal between the benign tissues, the primary tumors and the metastases where the metastases stained the weakest (P &lt;= 0.001). SOX10 downregulation resulted in variable effects on proliferation and migration rates in the melanoma cell lines.

Materials and Methods: In the present study, the Swedish National Cancer Registry databases were used to identify patients with laryngeal cancer diagnosed during the years 1978-2004 in the Uppsala-Örebro region and treated with radiotherapy. The expression of Ki-67, MutS homolog 2, (MSH2), p53, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and cyclin D1 in the cancer cells was assessed immunohistochemically using tissue microarrays (TMAs) and its predictve value on survival and relapse was analyzed using Cox regression models. Results: A total of 39 patients were included in the present study. Nuclear MSH2 staining was statistically significantly correlated to Ki-67 expression (p=0.022).

Here, the predictive value of HMG-CoAR expression in relation to tamoxifen response was examined. Methods: HMG-CoAR protein and RNA expression was analyzed in a cell line model of tamoxifen resistance using western blotting and PCR. HMG-CoAR mRNA expression was examined in 155 tamoxifen-treated breast tumors obtained from a previously published gene expression study (Cohort I). HMG-CoAR protein expression was examined in 422 stage II premenopausal breast cancer patients, who had previously participated in a randomized control trial comparing 2 years of tamoxifen with no systemic adjuvant treatment (Cohort II). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to estimate the risk of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and the effect of HMG-CoAR expression on tamoxifen response. Results: HMG-CoAR protein and RNA expression were decreased in tamoxifen-resistant MCF7-LCC9 cells compared with their tamoxifen-sensitive parental cell line. HMG-CoAR mRNA expression was decreased in tumors that recurred following tamoxifen treatment (P &lt; 0.001) and was an independent predictor of RFS in Cohort I (hazard ratio = 0.63, P = 0.009). In Cohort II, adjuvant tamoxifen increased RFS in HMG-CoAR-positive tumors (P = 0.008). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that HMG-CoAR was an independent predictor of improved RFS in Cohort II (hazard ratio = 0.67, P = 0.010), and subset analysis revealed that this was maintained in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients (hazard ratio = 0.65, P = 0.029). Multivariate interaction analysis demonstrated a difference in tamoxifen efficacy relative to HMG-CoAR expression (P = 0.05). Analysis of tamoxifen response revealed that patients with ER-positive/HMG-CoAR tumors had a significant response to tamoxifen (P = 0.010) as well as patients with ER-positive or HMG-CoAR-positive tumors (P = 0.035). Stratification according to ER and HMG-CoAR status demonstrated that ER-positive/HMG-CoAR-positive tumors had an improved RFS compared with ER-positive/HMG-CoAR-negative tumors in the treatment arm (P = 0.033); this effect was lost in the control arm (P = 0.138), however, suggesting that HMG-CoAR predicts tamoxifen response. Conclusions: HMG CoAR expression is a predictor of response to tamoxifen in both ER-positive and ER-negative disease. Premenopausal patients with tumors that express ER or HMG-CoAR respond to adjuvant tamoxifen.']\n",

      "['The special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2), a nuclear matrix-associated transcription factor and epigenetic regulator, was identified as a tissue type-specific protein when screening protein expression patterns in human normal and cancer tissues using an antibody-based proteomics approach. In this respect, the SATB2 protein shows a selective pattern of expression and, within cells of epithelial lineages, SATB2 expression is restricted to glandular cells lining the lower gastrointestinal tract. The expression of SATB2 protein is primarily preserved in cancer cells of colorectal origin, indicating that SATB2 could function as a clinically useful diagnostic marker to distinguish colorectal cancer (CRC) from other types of cancer. The aim of this study was to further explore and validate the specific expression pattern of SATB2 as a clinical biomarker and to compare SATB2 with the well-known cytokeratin 20 (CK20). Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the extent of SATB2 expression in tissue microarrays with tumors from 9 independent cohorts of patients with primary and metastatic CRCs (n = 1882). Our results show that SATB2 is a sensitive and highly specific marker for CRC with distinct positivity in 85% of all CRCs, and that SATB2 and/or CK20 was positive in 97% of CRCs. In conclusion, the specific expression of SATB2 in a large majority of CRCs suggests that SATB2 can be used as an important complementary tool for the differential diagnosis of carcinoma of unknown primary origin.']\n",

In this study, the prognostic value of immunohistochemical RBM3 expression was assessed in incident cases of malignant melanoma from a prospective population-based cohort study. Methods: Until Dec 31(st) 2008, 264 incident cases of primary invasive melanoma had been registered in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study. Histopathological and clinical information was obtained for available cases and tissue microarrays (TMAs) constructed from 226 (85.6%) suitable paraffin-embedded tumours and 31 metastases. RBM3 expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry on the TMAs and a subset of full-face sections. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparison of RBM3 expression and relevant clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to assess the relationship between RBM3 and recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: RBM3 could be assessed in 215/226 (95.1%) of primary tumours and all metastases. Longitudinal analysis revealed that 16/31 (51.6%) of metastases lacked RBM3 expression, in contrast to the primary tumours in which RBM3 was absent in 3/215 (1.4%) cases and strongly expressed in 120/215 (55.8%) cases. Strong nuclear RBM3 expression in the primary tumour was significantly associated with favourable clinicopathological parameters; i. e. non-ulcerated tumours, lower depth of invasion, lower Clark level, less advanced clinical stage, low mitotic activity and non-nodular histological type, and a prolonged RFS (RR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.27-0.91) and OS (RR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.20-0.64). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the beneficial prognostic value of RBM3 remained significant for OS (RR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.18-0.61). Conclusions: In line with previous in vitro data, we here show that RBM3 is down-regulated in metastatic melanoma and high nuclear RBM3 expression in the primary tumour is an independent marker of a prolonged OS. The potential utility of RBM3 in treatment stratification of patients with melanoma should be pursued in future studies.']\n",

METHODS: Using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry, PODXL expression was evaluated in 536 incident CRC cases from a prospective, population-based cohort study. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to assess the impact of PODXL expression on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: High PODXL expression was significantly associated with unfavourable clinicopathological characteristics, a shorter CSS (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38-2.84, P &lt; 0.001) and 5-year OS (HR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.29-2.64, P = 0.001); the latter remaining significant in multivariate analysis (HR = 1.52; 95% CI 1.03-2.25, P = 0.036).

The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic impact of immunohistochemical RBM3 expression in prostate cancer. Findings: Immunohistochemical RBM3 expression was examined in a tissue microarray with malignant and benign prostatic specimens from 88 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for localized disease. While rarely expressed in benign prostate gland epithelium, RBM3 was found to be up-regulated in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and present in various fractions and intensities in invasive prostate cancer. High nuclear RBM3 expression was significantly associated with a prolonged time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) (HR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.93, p = 0.024) and clinical progression (HR 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01-0.71, p = 0.021).

Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that high nuclear expression of RBM3 in prostate cancer is associated with a prolonged time to disease progression and, thus, a potential biomarker of favourable prognosis. The value of RBM3 for prognostication, treatment stratification and follow-up of prostate cancer patients should be further validated in larger studies.']\n",

This recognition follows a change in our understanding of the characteristics of the innovation process as a non-linear process and having a systemic character. This changed understanding is also reflected in the movement in policy focus from <em>science</em> and <em>technology</em> (S&amp;T) policy towards <em>innovation</em> policy. In recent years, the IS approach has been downscaled from the national level (NIS) to the regional level (RIS), a system's level that has gained the interest of policy makers.

This paper argues that when the IS approach is put into policy practice and downscaled to the regional level, it stands the risk of losing its strength as a tool for coping with the structural problems connected to innovation and globalization. Based on the identified challenges, the paper is concluded with a number of more general policy implications for IS-based policies with regional intentions.\"]\n",

We observe an implementation gap between the high-level policy ambitions relating to environmental governance of the waste sector, as expressed in national policy frameworks, and the local-level decision-making procedures and outcomes. Several discrepancies are identified: between national waste policy and the local decision premises, between local waste planning and project decision making, between knowledge gathering and project decision making, and between the legal mechanism in the development consent process and the national environmental quality objectives framework. Our study indicates that the governance frameworks at different levels are quite different, and at least partly incompatible, which causes important coordination problems across levels. Sectoral developments towards an industrial marketisation of waste have rendered frameworks such as local waste plans obsolete. We also find that the more traditional and coercive forms of governing the sector, such as consent, bans, and taxes, are the ones that have steering power, whereas new procedures, such as management by objectives, lack sufficient institutional and cognitive support structures to be effective.']\n",

      "['Hydrogen storage in TiCr2 alloy of AB(2) type with C15 Laves phase structure has been studied using density functional theory and plane-wave pseudopotential technique. The H atom interacts stronger with Cr atoms than with Ti and tends to occupy the g (2A2B) site due to the largest interstitial space. The g sites together with e (1A3B) sites form a three-dimensional clathratelike network, providing a diffusion pathway for H atoms, and the energy barriers for the H diffusion along these paths were computed. Interaction between two interstitial H atoms inside the TiCr2 lattice can be considered as a screened Coulomb repulsion, which seems to control the maximum hydrogen content in the metal hydrides. The absorption energies and electronic structures of metal hydrides TiCr2Hx with x=0.5-12 have been computed, and the theoretical maximum hydrogen storage capacity (between 2.6 and 3.8 wt %) agrees with experiments. The effects of the lattice expansion due to hydrogen absorption of different amounts have also been investigated.']\n",

The most favorable adsorption sites from our DFT results are on the top of an oxygen atom for the B3O3 ring and on the top of the center of the C-C bond for the benzene ring when a single H-2 is interacting with the COF-1. The adsorption energy trend obtained from the DFT calculations is found to be in good agreement with the MP2 binding energy trend. The binding preferences are slightly changed when high hydrogen loading is considered. H-2 molecules prefer to be trapped on the top of the carbon atoms of the benzene ring and also on the top of the oxygen atoms of the B3O3 ring. These findings are confirmed by hydrogen center-of-mass distribution results obtained using molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, our DFT results reveal that the hydrogen adsorption energies are boosted when we increase the number of hydrogen loadings due to attractive H-2-H-2 interactions. In addition, the nonavailability of the remaining adsorption sites in the COF-1 leads to a reduction of the H-2 mobility.']\n",

Theoretical values were calculated using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation energy functional. The obtained theoretical values are quite similar within both approximations. The found differences originate in the tiny structural differences. It is concluded that the expansion or contraction of the crystal lattice has smaller effect on the SCLSs than the geometrical details of the reconstruction, which suggests that the Madelung potential has the dominant effect on the SCLSs.

When two TM ions are placed close to each other (TM-TM distance of about 3.4 angstrom), the ferromagnetic ordering is found to be the lowest-energy configuration. The only exception is Fe, which possesses a half-filled 3d band. However, for further separation distance of about 7.2 angstrom, only Co, Ni and Cu ions (having more than half-filled 3d band) still prefer the ferromagnetic orientation, while V, Cr, or Mn ions (having less than half-filled 3d band) prefer antiferromagnetic ordering. The energies of the 3d band for TM ions show a decrease with increasing TM atomic number. For V, Cr and Mn, the 3d bands are merged with the conduction band, and show less hybridization with the host valence band; while for Co, Ni and Cu, the 3d bands show strong hybridization with the host valence band mainly formed by the oxygen 2p state.

The analysis results indicate availability of substantial coolability margins compared to previous assessments based on models and experiments using an idealized bed configuration (e.g. 1 D homogenous debris layer). Notably, high porosity (up to 70%) of debris beds, obtained in experiments and expected to be the case of prototypical debris beds, could increase the dryout heat flux by 100% and more, depending on particle size, compared with the dryout heat flux predicted for debris beds with traditionally assumed porosity of approximately 40%. Bed inhomogeneity represented by micro-channels in a mini bed is predicted to enhance the dryout heat flux by up to similar to 50%, even if the micro-channels occupy only a small volume fraction (e.g., less than 4%) of the bed.

Water subcooling and pool depth are found to significantly influence the debris fragments' morphology and agglomeration. When particle agglomeration is absent, the tests produced debris beds with porosity of similar to 60 to 70%. This porosity is significantly higher than the similar to 40% porosity broadly used in contemporary analysis of corium debris coolability in light water reactor severe accidents. The impact of debris formation on corium coolability is further complicated by debris fragments' sharp edges, roughened surfaces, and cavities that are partially or fully encapsulated within the debris fragments. These observations are made consistently in both the DEFOR-S experiments and other tests with prototypic and simulant corium melts. Synthesis of the debris fragments from the DEFOR-S tests conducted under different melt and coolant conditions reveal trends in particle size, particle sphericity, surface roughness, sharp edges, and internal porosity as functions of water subcooling and melt composition.

To date no information on the pressure drop due to the grate-bed resistance has been found. The objective of this paper is to propose a correlation that can predict the total effectof pressure drop (caused by bed resistance and grate-bed resistance), through a grate of a certain surface porosity (open area/total area) covered by the porous bed. The term related to the grate-bed resistance is based on the effective grate porosity, which combined surface bed porosity with geometrical criteria of the grate. Based on this a new term has been integrated into the Ergun-™s equation. The prediction has been validated within the experimental work conducted on a 0.7MW downdraft fixed-bed gasifier fueled with wood pellets. In this study, three grates of different porosities and thicknesses have been tested using various operating conditions. The predicted values of pressure drop showed a good agreement within the experimental results with ±7.10% of uncertainty. Although, the lower grate porosity, the higher conversion of fuel and heating value of gas is produced, the stability of the process is disturbed; therefore the grate porosity reduction below 20% is not recommended.']\n",

This raises the issue of extrapolating results obtained from laboratory experiments to the field scale. As sorption is generally related to the surface area of the geological material, it is then important to consider the dependency of the specific surface area on the particle size. In this work, BET surface area determinations of samples of different particle sizes are conducted on two minerals commonly found in granite: labradorite and magnetite. The results show a linearre lationship between BET surface area and the inverse of the particle size, up to a certain particle size. Furthermore, results also show that the specific surface area for intact, larger pieces is much smaller than the one predicted by a linear extrapolation of results on crushed material. Therefore, extrapolation of BET area for fine particles to the field situation will lead to an overestimation of the surface area and thereby also the radionuclide sorption, if sorption coefficients are extrapolated as well. Also of importance is that these results show that sorption experiments on crushed material may dominantly reflect properties of new surface, created during the mechanically treatment of the samples.']\n",

The same types of particles were then loaded in the test section of the POMECO-HT facility to obtain the dryout heat fluxes of the particulate beds heated volumetrically.

Given the effective particle diameter, both the pressure drop and the dryout heat flux of two-phase flow through the bed can be predicted by the Reed model. The experiment also shows that the bottom injection of coolant improves the dryout heat flux significantly and the first dryout position is moving upward with increasing bottom injection flowrate. Compared with top-flooding case, the dryout heat flux of the bed can be doubled if the superficial velocity of coolant injection is 0.21-“0.27 mm/s.

We analyze the proposed scheme and optimize the cooperation level (i.e., the fraction of the message that the relay should transmit). We compare our scheme with conventional repetition in which the relay retransmits the entire decoded message, with parallel coding, and additionally with dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF). We provide a finite-SNR analysis for all the collaborative schemes. The analysis reveals that the proposed partial repetition method can provide a gain of several dB over conventional repetition. It also shows that in general, power allocation is less important provided that one optimally allocates bandwidth. Surprisingly, the proposed scheme is able to achieve the same performance as that of parallel coding for some relay network configurations, but at a much lower complexity.']\n",

This paper studies the achievable DMT of the same network when the relay is constrained to make use of standard (non-WZ) source coding.

Upper bounds on the distortion exponents achieved with partial CSIT under a long-term power constraint are developed. It is shown that the distortion exponent with perfect CSIT grows unbounded as the ratio between the channel and source bandwidth increases, while the exponent achieved with any feedback link of fixed, finite resolution is bounded above by a polynomial of the product between the number of transmit and number of receive antennas. The resolution of the feedback link should grow with the bandwidth ratio to make the distortion exponent scale as fast as that in the perfect-CSIT case. We show that in order to achieve the optimal scaling the CSIT feedback resolution must grow logarithmically with the bandwidth ratio for MIMO channels, and faster than linear for the single-input single-output channel. The achievable distortion exponent of some hybrid schemes with heavily quantized feedback is also derived. The results demonstrate that dramatic performance improvement over the case of no CSIT can be achieved by combining simple schemes with a very coarse CSIT feedback.']\n",

The network consists of statistically independent noisy channels. The sink bit error probability (BEP) is the performance measure. First, we investigate soft-decision decoding without statistical information on the upstream channels (the channels not directly connected to the sink). Numerical results show that the decoder cannot significantly improve the performance from a hard-decision decoder. We develop union bounds for analysis. The bounds show the asymptotic (regarding SNR: signal-to-noise ratio) performance of the decoder. Using statistical information about the upstream channels, we can find the error patterns of final hop channels (channels directly connected to sinks).With the error patterns, maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding can be performed, and a significant improvement in the BEP is obtained. To evaluate the union bound for the ML decoder, we use an equivalent point procedure. It is reduced to the least-squares problem with a linear constraint in the medium-to-high SNR region. With deterministic knowledge of the errors in the upstream channels, a genie-aided decoder can further improve the performance. We give the union bound for the genie decoder, which is straightforward to evaluate.

It has been demonstrated that the low transverse shear modulus G(RT) in spruce contributes to large transverse strain inhomogeneities due to the annual ring structure in combination with shear coupling effects. In the present study, improved understanding of annual ring effects is achieved by the development of a micromechanical model. It relates the functional density gradient in spruce annual rings to shear modulus GRT. The geometrical basis is a hexagonal cell model, and in shear it is demonstrated to deform primarily by cell wall bending. Full-field strain measurements by digital speckle photography (DSP) show very strong correlation with predicted shear strains at the annual ring scale. Predictions are obtained by implementation of the micromechanics model in a finite element (FE) model developed for the single cube apparatus shear specimen. The low GRT of spruce is due to the strong dependence of GRT on relative density rho/rho(s)(G(RT) proportional to (rho/rho(s))(3)). This is particularly important in spruce. Even though average density is typically quite high, the functional gradient structure includes local densities as low as 200 kg/m(3).']\n",

Due to the number of design variables and constraints a structural optimisation method based on the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) is implemented and used to minimise the structural weight per square meter of panel for a typical accommodation deck configuration. It is concluded that, within the span of production parameters and rule requirements, substantial improvements can be made with or without an adhesively bonded core. Without core material and without any changes to the surrounding structure the structural weight for standard production panels can be reduced considerably, by reducing the face plate thickness and by using thinner and fewer webs. Additional weight can be saved by removing all but a few webs and injecting low-cost polyurethane foam into the cavities, giving added thermal-acoustic insulation, or by incorporating a more structural core with greater thickness and higher density, by which the free span of the sandwich panel can be increased.']\n",

The result of the simulation  shows that the best effective option in terms of aquifer groundwater  levels is the fifth proposed scenario and the sixth proposed scenario is  the best effective option in terms of aquifer groundwater salinity  situation during the next 15 years. This project suggested the  application of scenario 6 as it is environmentally sound in terms of  sustainable management. A prediction has been made which shows that  further actions have to be taken within the next two decades to ensure  continuity of the municipal water supply. The management scenarios are  examined in the case of the Salalah coastal aquifer using groundwater  simulation, which can also be applied to other regions with similar  conditions. The established model is considered a reasonable  representation of the physical conditions of the Salalah plain aquifer,  and can be used as a tool by the water and environmental authorities in  the management of the groundwater in the region.']\n",

Providing that this information is available and the uncertainty is within an acceptable range, computer models can be helpful tools in quantifying environmental effects. This study describes the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity for three soil types: clay, glacial till and sand. These soils originated from a Swedish database containing 2200 measured soil layers representing 260 soil profiles. A simulation experiment was conducted where daily variations in water and chloride were simulated for a 20-year period in central Sweden, using the different soil profiles sampled from the database. Two approaches to calculate effective parameters were tested, in order to obtain generic soil descriptions and examine their ability to represent the average of the variation in chloride and water characteristics obtained for the respective soil type. In general, the use of these effective parameters was successful but overestimations of the water and chloride outflow occurred in the clay, which presented high spatial variability, and of the chloride concentration in the sand, which presented high temporal variability. Overall, the generic soil descriptions were useful in producing reasonable behaviour regarding water and chloride dynamics and could be recommended for general assessments of the environmental impact of non-reactive solutes from ;areas where simplified soil classifications are available.']\n",

The implication is that only periods longer than about 50 days can be reliably represented in the model based on the available data. An improved method reflecting soil water retention in terms of cumulative evapotranspiration, so that its value is less dependent on soil storage and more dependent on antecedent climate, is used. The improved method is attractive for Ethiopian conditions due to limited soil data availability and the fact that the time-scale of cumulative evaporation can be evaluated over periods longer than 50 days. The spectrum analysis was done on the available nearby climatic data in three watersheds in Ethiopia to analyze the effects of data limitation on the temporal and spatial scales suitable to account for in comparta-mentalized runoff models. The time scales of SWAT for the surface runoff and groundwater flow response were constrained so as to be consistent with the results of the spectrum analysis. The performance of the SWAT model to predict daily stream flow response was compared to the Seasonal Model (SM) and the Original Linear Purturbation Model (OLPM) both of which need previous seasonal behavior of the stream flow.']\n",

The SWAT model was used to estimate the sediment yield within each sub-basin and identify the most sediment contributing areas in the basin. Using the NICE analysis, an attempt was made to combine a set of factors (land use, soil, slope and river layers) to make a decision according to the stated objective. On the basis of simulated SWAT, sediment yields greater than 30 tons/ha for each of the sub-basin area, 18.4% of the watershed was determined to be high erosion potential area. The NICE results indicated that 12-30.5% of the watershed is high erosion potential area. Both approaches show comparable watershed area with high soil erosion susceptibility. The output of this research can aid policy and decision makers in determining the soil erosion 'hot spots' and the relevant soil and water conservation measures.

      "[\"Buyuk Menderes catchment, located in the southwestern part of Turkey, is one of the most populated river basins in Turkey with 2.5 millions inhabitants. Due to increasing activities in agriculture and industrial sectors, water resources management in the basin is one of the biggest matters for the future. During the past decade, it has been observed a basinwide shift to larger monocultural, intensively operated farm units. Therefore, there is land use conversion from native lands to agriculture. The threat of nutrients pollution, nitrogen and phosphorus, has become a preoccupation since many lands and rivers undergo a eutrophication process. The discharge of nutrients from Buyuk Menderes basin to the Aegean Sea through Buyuk Menderes river also needs to be reduced in order to bring the eutrophication problems under lasting control. In this paper, the PolFlow model embedded in PCraster is applied to the catchment for quantifying water and substances fluxes for the five-year period, 1999-2004. The implementation of the model in the catchment allows describing the water balance and thus nutrient transport on the landscape surface but also through the soil and aquifer's layers. Modeling process is complicated by the transfer of nutrients from diffuse and point-source emissions, managed by retention and periodic release from storages within the catchment. Modeling diffuse and point-source nutrient emissions contribution to river loads can be improved by better knowledge about spatial and temporal distribution of this retention and release in the basin.\"]\n",

This process can be used in water treatment to remove U(VI). To develop a consistent geochemical model for U(VI) adsorption to ferrihydrite, batch experiments were performed and previous data sets reviewed to optimize a set of surface complexation constants using the 3-plane CD-MUSIC model. To consider the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on U(VI) speciation, new parameters for the Stockholm Humic Model (SHM) were optimized using previously published data. The model, which was constrained from available X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy evidence, fitted the data well when the surface sites were divided into low- and high-affinity binding sites. Application of the model concept to other published data sets revealed differences in the reactivity of different ferrihydrites towards U(VI). Use of the optimized SHM parameters for U(VI)-DOM complexation showed that this process is important for U(VI) speciation at low pH. However in neutral to alkaline waters with substantial carbonate present, Ca-U-CO3 complexes predominate. The calibrated geochemical model was used to simulate U(VI) adsorption to ferrihydrite for a hypothetical groundwater in the presence of several competitive ions. The results showed that U(VI) adsorption was strong between pH 5 and 8. Also near the calcite saturation limit, where U(VI) adsorption was weakest according to the model, the adsorption percentage was predicted to be &gt;80%. Hence U(VI) adsorption to ferrihydrite-containing sorbents may be used as a method to bring down U(VI) concentrations to acceptable levels in groundwater.']\n",

Modeled estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) or depth were compared to observations at forest and open sites at each location. Precipitation phase and duration of above-freezing air temperatures are shown to be major influences on divergence and convergence of modeled estimates of the subcanopy snowpack. When models are considered collectively at all locations, comparisons with observations show that it is harder to model SWE at forested sites than open sites. There is no universal \"best\\'\\' model for all sites or locations, but comparison of the consistency of individual model performances relative to one another at different sites shows that there is less consistency at forest sites than open sites, and even less consistency between forest and open sites in the same year. A good performance by a model at a forest site is therefore unlikely to mean a good model performance by the same model at an open site (and vice versa). Calibration of models at forest sites provides lower errors than uncalibrated models at three out of four locations. However, benefits of calibration do not translate to subsequent years, and benefits gained by models calibrated for forest snow processes are not translated to open conditions.']\n",

Despite investments exceeding many millions of dollars, there are still substantial knowledge gaps about the prevalence and impact of As, notably in its epidemiology, temporal variations, social factors, patient identification, treatment, etc. Arsenic-affected people in the affected regions also face serious social problems.

Investigated sites included Sonargaon in Narayanganj, Chandina in Comilla and Sirajdikhan in Munshiganj districts. At all sites samples from different depths were collected, and water chemistry and redox status vs. depth trends were determined. The concentrations of DOC and HCO3- were highest at Sirajdikhan site, while at the Sonargaon and Chandina sites the concentrations were lower. On the contrary, the NH4+ concentration was high at the Chandina site as compared to the other sites. There was a good match between dissolved As and Fe at the Sirajdikhan and Sonargaon sites, but not at the Chandina site. The dissolved aqueous concentration of Mn was low at the Chandina site, which suggested that the Mn(IV) redox buffering step was missing. Speciation modeling indicated a possibility of siderite precipitation at all sites, but precipitation of rhodochrosite only at the Sonargaon and Sirajdikhan sites. At the Sirajdikhan site, the log P-CO2 values were very high (-1.37), which revealed the production Of CO2 in redox processes. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated an impact of sea water and redox status of different samples. These results suggest that the dissolved As is de-coupled from dissolved Mn because when released, As is re-adsorbed onto the Fe(Ill) minerals in solid phase, as well as from dissolved Fe when precipitation of Fe(II) minerals controls the aqueous concentrations of Fe. In addition, several other concurrent redox processes may exert kinetic constraints depending on refractory characteristics of Fe(II) minerals.']\n",

The relationships are investigated theoretically and by evaluation of experimental data for 41 organic and pharmaceutical compounds comprising a total of 115 solubility curves in organic and aqueous solvents. The work considers (i) selection of the equation for correlation of solubility data based on thermodynamic considerations and ability to predict melting properties of the solute from solubility data, (ii) prediction of the temperature dependence of solubility, and (iii) prediction of solubility curves in new solvents. While it is a simple task to find an equation to obtain a decent fit of experimental solubility data, it is more challenging to find relations that are sufficiently sound thermodynamically to allow for extrapolation to the melting temperature. However, with a proper choice of equation it is shown that the melting temperature of the solute can readily be predicted from solubility data in organic solvents (average accuracy of -5K, standard deviation of 26 K). Relationships are identified by which the entire solubility curve can be predicted of the compound in a new solvent using only the melting properties and a single solubility data point in that solvent.']\n",

The melting properties and isobaric heat capacities of both polymorphs have been determined calorimetrically, and the solubility of each polymorph in several solvents at different temperatures has been determined gravimetrically. The solid-state activity (i.e., the Gibbs free energy of fusion) of each polymorph has been determined through a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis based on experimental data. It is found that the polymorphs are enantiotropically related, with a stability transition temperature of 156.1 °0C. The published crystal structure belongs to the polymorph that is metastable at room temperature. Energytemperature diagrams of both polymorphs have been established by determining the free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of fusion as a function of temperature. A total of 300 cooling crystallizations have been carried out at constant cooling rate using different saturation temperatures and solvents, and the visible onset of primary nucleation was recorded. The results show that for this substance the polymorph that will nucleate depends chiefly on the solvent. In water and methanol solutions, the stable form I was obtained in all experiments, whereas in acetonitrile, a majority of nucleation experiments resulted in the isolation of the metastable form II. It is shown how this can be rationalized by analysis of solubility, solution speciation, and nucleation relationships.

The metastable zone width has been determined at constant cooling rate, and the time and temperature of the preceding superheating step have been varied. m-Hydroxybenzoic acid has two polymorphs, and the influence of the polymorph used to prepare the solutions has also been investigated. There is an overall tendency in the experiments for the solution to exhibit a larger metastable zone width if it is superheated for a longer time and at a higher temperature, but under the investigated conditions this tendency is not very strong. The results show that the metastable form II preferentially crystallizes in all experiments and in particular when the solution has been more strongly superheated for several hours. However, when the time and/or the temperature of superheating is reduced, there is an increasing tendency to obtain the stable form I. This is most clearly found for solutions prepared by dissolving form I. When the solutions are prepared by dissolution of form II, this tendency is weaker in what appears to be a systematic way. It is hypothesized that, unless the solution is strongly superheated for several hours, it will contain for a significant period of time clusters of solute molecules that can retain some degree of structure from the dissolved crystal. This leads to \"memory\" effects in the solution, which may influence subsequent nucleation.

In chloroform, the theophylline concentration of the saturated solution over the cocrystal is clearly higher than that in the saturated solution over pure theophylline I/II, while for glutaric acid the situation is the opposite. With the solubility data, the Gibbs free energy of the formation of the cocrystal from solid theophylline II and solid beta-glutaric acid at 30 degrees C can be estimated to -0.39 kJ mol(-1). The work reveals that polymorphism in the pure components of a cocrystal can dramatically influence the phase diagram and shift an incongruently dissolving case into a kinetically stabilized congruent case. In chloroform, the cocrystal dissolves incongruently with respect to the stable form I of theophylline but congruently with respect to the metastable theophylline II. However, the cocrystal is stable in a stoichiometric solution for more than 2 weeks. Given sufficient time, the system should transform into a solid phase being a mixture of cocrystal and stable theophylline I, in equilibrium with a solution that has the composition of the corresponding invariant point. In acetonitrile, where the glutaric acid solubility is much higher than that of theophylline II, the cocrystal dissolves, clearly incongruently. The region where the cocrystal is the only solid stable phase is clearly shifted toward the glutaric acid side and is fairly narrow. In both solvents the cocrystal can readily be produced by isothermal slurry conversion crystallization to a reasonable level of productivity, as long as the process is operated in a region of the phase diagram where the cocrystal is the only stable (or reasonably metastable) solid phase.']\n",

In both phases, substitutional Al decays from neutral charge state into the charge state -1, with the transition energy just above to the top of the valence band. Our findings indicate that by confining the Fermi energy to the region between the middle of the band gap and the bottom of the conduction band, high Al solubility could be achieved, although formation of Al is likely followed by the formation of interstitial oxygen. Furthermore, the concentration of Al with charge state -1 along with the equilibrium Fermi energy have been calculated in a self-consistent procedure.

The obtained concentrations of Al and oxygen vacancies follow the experimental trend but underestimates experimental data. When the formation of defect clusters, composed by two substitutional Al and one oxygen vacancy, are considered, good quantitative agreement with experimental values of both Al and oxygen vacancy concentration is achieved.

(ii) For acceptor concentrations N-A&gt;N-C, the hole gas of the metallic phase affects the band-edge energies and narrows the energy gap E-g=E-g(0)=Delta E-g. The energy shift of the valence-band maximum Delta E-v1 is roughly twice as large as the shift of the conduction-band minimum Delta E-c1. (iii) Delta E-v1 depends strongly on the non-parabolicity of the valence bands. (iv) Sulfur based compounds and Ga-rich alloys have the largest shifts of their band edges. (v) A high active acceptor concentrations of N-A = 10(20) cm(-3) implies a band-gap narrowing in the order of Delta E-g approximate to 0.2 eV, thus E-g=E-g(0)-0.2 eV, and an optical band gap of E-g(opt)approximate to E-g(0)-0.1 eV.\"]\n",

      "[\"Phylogeny is both a fundamental tool in biology and a rich source of fascinating modeling and algorithmic problems. Today's wealth of sequenced genomes makes it increasingly important to understand evolutionary events such as duplications, losses, transpositions, inversions, lateral transfers, and domain shuffling. We focus on the gene duplication event, that constitutes a major force in the creation of genes with new function [Ohno 1970; Lynch and Force 2000] and, thereby also, of biodiversity. We introduce the probabilistic gene evolution model, which describes how a gene tree evolves within a given species tree with respect to speciation, gene duplication, and gene loss. The actual relation between gene tree and species tree is captured by a reconciliation, a concept which we generalize for more expressiveness. The model is a canonical generalization of the classical linear birth-death process, obtained by replacing the interval where the process takes place by a tree. For the gene evolution model, we derive efficient algorithms for some associated probability distributions: the probability of a reconciled tree, the probability of a gene tree, the maximum probability reconciliation, the posterior probability of a reconciliation, and sampling reconciliations with respect to the posterior probability. These algorithms provides the basis for several applications, including species tree construction, reconciliation analysis, orthology analysis, biogeography, and host-parasite co-evolution.\"]\n",

      "['In the recent article [4], a theory for complexity-constrained interpolation of contractive functions is developed. In particular, it is shown that any such interpolant may be obtained as the unique minimizer of a (convex) weighted entropy gain. In this technical note we study this optimization problem in detail and describe how the minimizer depends on weight selection and on interpolation conditions. We first show that, if, for a sequence of interpolants, the values of the entropy gain of the interpolants converge to the optimum, then the interpolants converge in H-2, but not in H-infinity This result is then used to describe the asymptotic behavior of the interpolant as an interpolation point approaches the boundary of the domain of analyticity. For loop shaping to specifications in control design, it might at first seem natural to place strategically additional interpolation points close to the boundary. However, our results indicate that such a strategy will have little effect on the shape. Another consequence of our results relates to model reduction based on minimum-entropy principles, where one should avoid placing interpolation points too close to the boundary.']\n",

      "[\"In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the future asymptotic dynamics of spatially homogeneous cosmological models of Bianchi type VI0. Each of these models converges to a flat Kasner solution (Taub solution) for late times; we give detailed asymptotic expansions describing this convergence. In particular, we prove that the future asymptotics of Bianchi type VI0 solutions cannot be approximated in any way by Bianchi type II solutions, which is in contrast to Bianchi type VIII and IX models (in the direction toward the singularity). The paper contains an extensive introduction where we put the results into a broader context. The core of these considerations consists in the fact that there exist regions in the phase space of Bianchi type VIII models where solutions can be approximated, to a high degree of accuracy, by type VI0 solutions. The behavior of solutions in these regions is essential for the question of 'locality', i.e., whether particle horizons form or not. Since Bianchi type VIII models are conjectured to be important role models for generic cosmological singularities, our understanding of Bianchi type VI0 dynamics might thus be crucial to help to shed some light on the important question of whether to expect generic singularities to be local or not.\"]\n",

Exposure to near-ambient pressures of water vapor, at 5 Á— 10-3 %RH and 293 K, hydroxylates both Cu2O surfaces with OH coverage up to 0.38 copper monolayers (ML) for (100) and 0.25 ML for (111). O 1s surface core level shifts indicate that the hydroxylation lifts the (3,0;1,1) reconstruction of the clean (100) surface. On both clean Cu2O terminations, SO2 adsorbs to unsaturated surface oxygen atoms to form SO3 species with coverage, after a saturating SO2 dose, corresponding to 0.20 ML on the Cu2O(100) surface and 0.09 ML for the Cu2O(111) surface. Our combined DFT and PES results suggest that the SO2 to SO3 transformation is largely facilitated by unsaturated copper atoms at the Cu2O(111) surface. SO3-terminated surfaces exposed to low doses of water vapor (‰¤100 langmuirs) in ultrahigh vacuum show no adsorption or reaction. However, during exposure to near-ambient pressures of water vapor, the SO3 species dissociate, and sulfur replaces a Cu2O lattice oxygen in a reaction that forms Cu2S.

      "['A lipid core that occupies a high proportion of the plaque volume in addition to a thin fibrous cap is a predominant indicator of plaque vulnerability. Nowadays, noninvasive. imaging modalities can identify such structural components, however morphological criteria alone cannot reliably identify high-risk plaques. Information, such as stresses in the lesions components, seems to be essential. This work presents a methodology able to analyze the effect of changes in the lipid core and calcification on the wall stresses, in particular on the fibrous cap vulnerability. Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and histology of an ex vivo human atherosclerotic carotid bifurcation, a patient is gen-specific three-dimensional geometric model, consisting of four tissue components, erated. The adopted constitutive model accounts for the nonlinear and anisotropic tissue behavior incorporating the collagen fiber orientation by means of a novel and robust algorithm. The material parameters are identified from experimental data. A novel stress-based computational cap vulnerability index is proposed to assess quantitatively the rupture-risk of fibrous caps. Nonlinear finite element analyses identify that the highest stress regions are located at the vicinity of the shoulders of the fibrous cap and in the stiff calcified tissue. A parametric analysis reveals a positive correlation between the increase in lipid core portion and the mechanical stress in the fibrous cap and, hence, the risk for cap rupture. The highest values of the vulnerability index, which cot-relate to more vulnerable caps, are obtained for morphologies for which the lipid cores were severe; heavily loaded fibrous caps were thus detected. The proposed multidisciplinary methodology is able to investigate quantitatively the mechanical behavior of atherosclerotic plaques in patient-specific stenoses. The introduced vulnerability index may serve as a more quantitative tool for diagnosis, treatment and prevention. [DOI: 10.1115/1.']\n",

However, to successfully compose models one has to solve the issues of syntactic and semantic composability of components. The Base Object Model (BOM) standard is an attempt to ease reusability and composition of simulation models. However, the BOM does not contain sufficient information for defining necessary concepts and terms to avoid ambiguity, and neither does it have any method for dynamic aspects matching conceptual models (i.e., their state-machines).

We also present an OWL-S description for each component, including the state-machines.

Cyclic, quasi-static extension-inflation tests at different axial stretches are performed on preconditioned tube specimens. Stress-free configurations show significant stress releases in the circumferential direction of the intact CCA and ICA walls and in the axial directions of the intact CCA walls and the CCA and ICA adventitias. All investigated tissues exhibit strong nonlinear, pseudoelastic mechanical behavior with small hysteresis. The \"inversion\" feature, where the pressure/axial stretch relationship becomes a vertical line, is found only for intact walls. Axial \"inversion stretches\" are 1.15 (SD 0.06) for CCA and 1.14 (SD 0.06) for ICA, and related external axial forces are 0.43 N (SD 0.15) and 0.30 N (SD 0.22), respectively. Significant negative correlations between age and axial inversion stretches for CCA (r = -0.67, P = 0.03) and ICA (r = -0.29, P = 0.04) are identified. Adventitias are very compliant at low pressures, but change into stiff tubes at high pressures. The burst pressure of the adventitia is beyond 250 kPa. A relatively low burst pressure of similar to 60 kPa is found in the media-intima tubes, in which the pressure/circumferential stretch relationships are almost independent of the axial stretches. Stress analyses indicate a high degree of material anisotropy for all investigated tissues. High circumferential and axial stresses occur in the media-intima tubes at physiological conditions.

The underlying idea of this algorithm is to closely approximate the rank function with a smooth function of singular values, and then minimize the resulting approximation subject to the linear constraints. The accuracy of the approximation is controlled via a scaling parameter Î´, where a smaller Î´ corresponds to a more accurate fitting. The consequent optimization problem for any finite Î´ is nonconvex. Therefore, to decrease the risk of ending up in local minima, a series of optimizations is performed, starting with optimizing a rough approximation (a large Î´) and followed by successively optimizing finer approximations of the rank with smaller Î´'s. To solve the optimization problem for any Î´ &gt; 0, it is converted to a new program in which the cost is a function of two auxiliary positive semidefinite variables. The paper shows that this new program is concave and applies a majorize-minimize technique to solve it which, in turn, leads to a few convex optimization iterations. This optimization scheme is also equivalent to a reweighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (NNM). For any Î´ &gt; 0, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the exact recovery which are weaker than those corresponding to NNM. On the numerical side, the proposed algorithm is compared to NNM and a reweighted NNM in solving affine rank minimization and matrix completion problems showing its considerable and consistent superiority in terms of success rate.\"]\n",

It is shown that ADPM for nonconvexproblems asymptotically converges to a primal feasible pointunder mild conditions and an additional condition ensuringthat it asymptotically reaches the standard first order necessary conditions for local optimality are introduced. In thecase of the ADMM, novel sufficient conditions under whichthe algorithm asymptotically reaches the standard first ordernecessary conditions are established. Based on this, completeconvergence of ADMM for a class of low dimensional problemsare characterized. Finally, the results are illustrated by applyingADPM and ADMM to a nonconvex localization problem inwireless sensor networks.']\n",

      "['Computational methods are proposed for solving a convex quadratic program (QP). Active-set methods are defined for a particular primal and dual formulation of a QP with general equality constraints and simple lower bounds on the variables. In the first part of the paper, two methods are proposed, one primal and one dual. These methods generate a sequence of iterates that are feasible with respect to the equality constraints associated with the optimality conditions of the primal-dual form. The primal method maintains feasibility of the primal inequalities while driving the infeasibilities of the dual inequalities to zero. The dual method maintains feasibility of the dual inequalities while moving to satisfy the primal inequalities. In each of these methods, the search directions satisfy a KKT system of equations formed from Hessian and constraint components associated with an appropriate column basis. The composition of the basis is specified by an active-set strategy that guarantees the nonsingularity of each set of KKT equations. Each of the proposed methods is a conventional active-set method in the sense that an initial primal- or dual-feasible point is required. In the second part of the paper, it is shown how the quadratic program may be solved as a coupled pair of primal and dual quadratic programs created from the original by simultaneously shifting the simple-bound constraints and adding a penalty term to the objective function. Any conventional column basis may be made optimal for such a primal-dual pair of shifted-penalized problems. The shifts are then updated using the solution of either the primal or the dual shifted problem. An obvious application of this approach is to solve a shifted dual QP to define an initial feasible point for the primal (or vice versa). The computational performance of each of the proposed methods is evaluated on a set of convex problems from the CUTEst test collection.']\n",

      "[\"The Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT, hereafter LAT), the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view (FoV), high-energy gamma-ray telescope, covering the energy range from below 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. The LAT was built by an international collaboration with contributions from space agencies, high-energy particle physics institutes, and universities in France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This paper describes the LAT, its preflight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4 x 4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 (x, y) tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an eight-layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths, giving both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern. The calorimeter's depth and segmentation enable the high-energy reach of the LAT and contribute significantly to background rejection. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4, allowing a large FoV (2.4 sr) and ensuring that most pair-conversion showers initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement. Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (1) permit rapid notification of high-energy gamma-ray bursts and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (2) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (3) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (4) localize point sources to 0.3-2 arcmin, (5) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (6) measure the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray background up to TeV energies, and (7) explore the discovery space for dark matter.\"]\n",

Assuming that this depletion is a signature of the presence of charged dust particles, the main characteristics of dust down to submicron sized particles are derived. The differential size distribution is found to be well described by a power law with an index mu similar to 5.5-6 for the lower size limit a(min) = 0.03 mu m and mu similar to 7.3-8 for a(min) = 0.1 mu m. The calculated average integral dust number density is weakly affected by values of mu and a(min). For a greater than or similar to 0.1 mu m, both flybys gave the maximum dust density about 0.1-0.3 cm(-3) in the vicinity of Enceladus.

A quasi-static electric field structure with a downward parallel electric field forms at altitudes between 800 km and 5000 km, accelerating ionospheric electrons upward, away from the auroral ionosphere. A wealth of related phenomena, including energetic ion conics, electron solitary waves, low-frequency wave activity, and plasma density cavities occur in this region, which also acts as a source region for VLF saucers. Results are presented from sounding rockets and satellites, such as Freja, FAST, Viking, and Cluster, to illustrate the characteristics of the electric fields and related parameters, at altitudes below, within, and above the acceleration region. Special emphasis will be on the high-altitude characteristics and dynamics of quasi-static electric field structures observed by Cluster. These structures, which extend up to altitudes of at least 4-5 Earth radii, appear commonly as monopolar or bipolar electric fields. The former are found to occur at sharp boundaries, such as the polar cap boundary whereas the bipolar fields occur at soft plasma boundaries within the plasma sheet. The temporal evolution of quasi-static electric field structures, as captured by the pearls-on-a-string configuration of the Cluster spacecraft indicates that the formation of the electric field structures and of ionospheric plasma density cavities are closely coupled processes.

      "['Auroral arcs are typically described in terms of an upward field-aligned current (FAC) sheet above the arc, connected by ionospheric Pedersen current to a downward FAC sheet near the arc. On the basis of data measured by the FAST spacecraft, conjugate with ground optical observations, we present first a wide and stable winter evening arc, where this standard model does not apply. The arc is observed in the Harang region during the growth phase of a modest substorm, poleward of the convection reversal (CR) boundary. Although the magnetic field data suggest the typical configuration, the two FAC sheets appear to be decoupled near the satellite footprint: the upward FAC is fed by the westward electrojet (WEJ), while the downward FAC feeds the eastward electrojet (EEJ). The examination of the arc by the newly developed ALADYN technique confirms this peculiar current topology. For comparison, we apply ALADYN also to a second evening arc, located within the Harang region equatorward from the CR. The arc is confirmed to have the standard configuration, consistent with a former study, but substantial FAC-EJ coupling is inferred in the auroral oval both poleward and equatorward of the arc. A key element for the topology of the current closure is the westward component of the electric field, which influences the relative location of the CR with respect to the large-scale FAC reversal (FR) boundary. As proved by tests on synthetic data, a westward component of the electric field pushes the CR toward the FR, preventing thus the standard FAC closure, while the conductance and FAC pattern shape the CR profile. Since a westward electric field is often measured in the Harang region, the FAC-EJ coupling is expected to be an essential ingredient there. This has important implications for the current closure in the equatorial magnetosphere and for the auroral current circuit in the WEJ region, closely related to the substorm process.']\n",

Results are presented from a preliminary analysis of a selection of electric field events observed by Cluster above the acceleration region. The degree of coupling is here estimated as the ratio between the magnetic field-aligned potential drop,Delta Phi(II), as inferred from the characteristic energy of upward ion (electron) beams for the upward (downward) current region and the high-altitude perpendicular (to B) potential, Delta Phi(perpendicular to), as calculated by integrating the perpendicular electric field across the structure. For upward currents, the coupling can be expressed analytically, using the linear current-voltage relation, as outlined by Weimer et al. (1985). This gives a scale size dependent coupling where structures are coupled (decoupled) above (below) a critical scale size. For downward currents, the current-voltage relation is highly non-linear which complicates the understanding of how the coupling works. Results from this experimental study indicate that small-scale structures are decoupled, similar to small-scale structures in the upward current region. There are, however, exceptions to this rule as illustrated by Cluster results of small-scale intense electric fields, correlated with downward currents, indicating a perfect coupling between the ionosphere and Cluster altitude.']\n",

The spatial and temporal development of the acceleration structures is studied, given the magnetic conjunction opportunity and the one minute difference between the Cluster spacecraft crossings. The configuration allowed for estimation of characteristic times of development for the two structures and of the parallel electric field and potential drop for the more stable one. The first potential structure had a width of similar to 80 km (projected to the ionosphere) and was relatively short-lived, developing in less than 40 s and decaying in one minute. The parallel potential drop increased between altitudes of 1.13 R(E) and 1.3 R(E), whereas the acceleration potential above 1.3 R(E) remained almost unchanged during that time. This intensification occurred mainly after the time when the associated upward current had reached its maximum value. The second structure had a width of similar to 50 km and was subject to an increase by a factor of 3 of the parallel potential drop below 1.3 R(E), during about 40 s, after which it remained rather stable for one minute or more. Similarly here, the acceleration potential above 1.3 R(E) remained roughly unchanged. For the more stable second structure, an average parallel electric field between 1.13 and 1.3 R(E) could be estimated (similar to 0.56 mV/m).

A bipolar lightning flash occurrence of 3% (21/652) is found during the 10-year observation period. Thirteen (62% or 13/21) of them occurred in nonconvective season (September-March). On the basis of the classification suggested by Rakov and Uman (2003), 13 (62%) of the 21 bipolar flashes belong to Type 1 associated with a polarity reversal during the initial stage (IS) current, five belong to Type 2 associated with different polarities of the IS current and the following return strokes, one belongs to Type 3 associated with return strokes of opposite polarity following the IS, and two of them are not assigned. We also find that the initial polarity reversal from negative to positive occurs more often (76% or 16/21) than that from positive to negative within a bipolar flash, in agreement with observations in other studies. The geometric mean (GM) and arithmetic mean (AM) of the total absolute charge transfer are 99.5 C and 125 C, with the GM and AM total flash duration of 320 ms and 396 ms, respectively. From simultaneous current and high-speed video measurements of one bipolar flash, within the field of view, the positive charge was transferred along one branch initially, followed by the negative charge transfer after cessation of the luminosity for 142 ms, while the other two branches connected to the main channel always contributed to the negative charge transfer during the whole process.']\n",

The particle and field data are used to infer the acceleration potentials of the arcs and their distribution in altitude and latitude. The C1 data are consistent with a symmetric potential pattern, composed of two negative U potentials and one positive U potential in between, and the C3 and C4 data are consistent with an asymmetric pattern, where the dominating potential structure extends deep into the polar cap boundary (PCB) region. The two patterns may either correspond to different stages of evolution of the same double arc system or represent two longitudinally separated double arc systems. For all spacecraft, the potential well of the poleward arc extends into the PCB region, whereas the density cavity does not but remains confined to R1. This suggests that the Alfvenic activity observed within the PCB region prevents the cavity formation, consistent with the associated FACs being roughly balanced over this region. The results show that Alfvenic and quasi-static acceleration operates jointly in the PCB region, varying from being about equally important (on C1) to being predominantly quasi-static (on C3/C4). The presence (absence) of an upward electron beam, associated with a positive potential structure and a downward current, observed by C1 (C4/C3) is expected from its short life time, shorter than the time lag between the Cluster spacecraft. The evolution involves both a broadening and a density reduction of the associated downward current sheet to below the critical current density above which parallel electric fields will form. The deepest potential well of 13 kV observed by C4 was located in Region 1, adjacent to the PCB region and coinciding with the deepest density cavity, with a minimum density of 0.1 cm(-3). The interface between Region 1 and the PCB region, coinciding with the steep density gradient, appears to be the leading edge of the cavity.']\n",

      "['The current configuration in the auroral region is known to consist typically of downward and upward field-aligned current (FAC) sheets, connected in the ionosphere by meridional Pedersen currents, while divergence free electrojets (EJs) flow azimuthally as Hall currents. This configuration of the auroral current circuit was introduced by Bostrom (1964) and labeled as \"Type 2,\" while he suggested also an alternative \"Type 1\" configuration, with filamentary FACs connected in the ionosphere by azimuthal Pedersen currents. By using an updated version of the recently developed ALADYN technique, we investigated the divergence of the auroral electrojets for a few FAST crossings over the auroral oval in the 20-22 MLT sector, two of which are presented in detail. Although a precise estimate of the electrojet divergence is difficult, because of several error sources, the results suggest that this divergence can be significant over certain latitude ranges, comparable with the FAC density. Direct FAC-EJ coupling appears to contribute to the ionospheric current closure not only during active times, as already known, but also during rather quiet periods. The quiet time FAC-EJ coupling is likely to be achieved in a mixed \"Type 1/Type 2\" configuration, with the FAC sheet (Type 1) azimuthally connected to the Pedersen component of the EJ (Type 2). This configuration requires a non-zero tangential component of the electric field, and is therefore more likely realized inside or near the Harang region. At the same time, the divergence of the Hall current is presumably negligible, and likewise the ionospheric polarization, consistent with statistical results published recently. During more active intervals and possible reconfigurations of the auroral current circuit, our results suggest that the FAC-EJ coupling could be also achieved by Hall currents. We conclude by exploring a tentative scenario for the integrated evolution of the ionospheric current closure and Cowling mechanism during the substorm cycle. A systematic examination of more experimental evidence is needed to validate this scenario.']\n",

The topographic and atmospheric biases can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics and studying these biases gives some ideas about analytical downward continuation of these quantities to sea level. In formulation of harmonic coefficients of the topographic and atmospheric biases, a truncated binomial expansion of topographic height is used.

Alloying with a small amount of a neighboring metal can either stabilize or destabilize the body-centered-cubic phase relative to low-symmetry rhombohedral phases. We show that band-structure effects determine phase stability when a particular group VB metal is alloyed with its nearest neighbors within the same d-transition series. In this case, the neighbor with less (to the left) and more (to the right) d electrons destabilize and stabilize bcc, respectively. When alloying with neighbors of higher d-transition series, electrostatic Madelung energy dominates and stabilizes the body-centered-cubic phase. This surprising prediction invalidates current understanding of simple d-electron bonding that dictates high-symmetry cubic and hexagonal phases.']\n",

      "['Various approaches for removal of high-abundance components in body fluids are currently available. While most methods are constructed for plasma depletion, there is a need for body-fluid-specific strategies. The aim of the present study was to design an affinity matrix suitable for the depletion of high-abundance proteins in CSIF (cerebrospinal fluid). Hence, molecules with specific affinity towards proteins present at high concentration in CSIF were desired. Affibody(R) molecules are specific binders of small size that have shown high stability under various conditions and are therefore good candidates for such a matrix. The protein composition in CSF resembles that in plasma. However, 20 % of the proteins are brain-derived and are therefore present in higher proportions in CSF than in plasma, whereas larger plasma-derived proteins are less abundant in CSF. Therefore five high-abundance CSIF proteins were chosen for the design of a CSF-specific depletion setup. Affibody(R) molecules with specificity towards HSA (human serum albumin), IgG, transferrin and transthyretin were combined in an affinity column. In addition, polyclonal antibodies against cystatin C were coupled to chromatographic beads and packed in a separate column. Highly reproducible and efficient removal of the five target proteins was observed. The proportion of depleted proteins were estimated to be 99, 95, 74, 92 and 83 % for HSA, IgG, transferrin, transthyretin and cystatin C respectively. SDS/PAGE analysis was used for monitoring and identifying proteins in native CSF, depleted CSIF samples and the captured fractions. Moreover, shotgun proteomics was used for protein identification in native as well as depleted: CSIF and the achieved data were compared. Enhanced identification of lower abundance components was observed in the depleted fraction, in terms of more detected peptides per protein.']\n",

Vectors encoding individual members of a naive 10(9) affibody protein library fused to a C-terminal fragment of the beta-lactamase reporter were distributed via phage infection to a culture of cells harbouring a common construct encoding a fusion protein between a non-membrane anchored version of a human TNF-alpha target and the N-terminal segment of the reporter. An initial binding analysis of 29 library variants derived from surviving colonies using selection plates containing ampicillin and in some cases also the P-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam, indicated a stringent selection for target binding variants. Subsequent analyses showed that the binding affinities (K(D)) for three selected variants studied in more detail were in the range 14-27 nm. The selectivity in binding to TNF-alpha for these variants was further demonstrated in both a cross-target PCA-based challenge and the specific detection of a low nm concentration of TNF-alpha spiked into a complex cell lysate sample. Further, in a biosensor-based competition assay, the binding to TNF-alpha of three investigated affibody variants could be completely blocked by premixing the target with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody adalimumab (Humira (R)), indicating overlapping epitopes between the two classes of reagents. The data indicate that beta-lactamase PICA is a promising methodology for stringent selection of binders from complex naive libraries to yield high affinity reagents with selective target binding characteristics.']\n",

We have previously argued that a low sequence identity to other proteins is a key feature for antigens used in antibody generation. Thus, a major challenge for whole-proteome studies is how to address families of highly sequence related proteins within the context of generating specific antibodies. In this study, two non-overlapping parts of human Cytokeratin-17, a protein belonging to the intermediate filament family of highly sequence-related proteins, were selected as a model system to study the specificity and cross reactivity of antibodies generated towards such a target. These recombinantly produced Protein Epitope Signature Tags (PrESTs) were immunized in five rabbits each and the batch-to-batch variations in the obtained immune responses were studied by mapping of linear epitopes using synthetic overlapping peptides. The obtained results showed a similar but not identical immune response in the respective antibody groups with a limited number of epitopes being identified. Immunohistochemical analysis of the affinity purified monospecific antibodies on tissue micro arrays resulted in a general recognition of human cytokeratins for all analyzed binders whereas antibodies identified as binding to the most unique parts of the PrESTs showed the most Cytokeratin-17 like staining. The data presented here support the strategy to use sequence identity scores as the main criteria for antigen selection but also indicate the possibility to instead produce a single antibody recognizing a defined group of proteins when the intended targets overall sequence identity score is too high.

In the present study we have generated c-Jun-binding-affinity proteins from a phage-displayed library of so-called 'Affibody (R) ligands', developed by combinatorial engineering of a non-immunoglobulin-based scaffold protein. Homodimeric c-Jun protein was recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli and, prior to selection, the quality of the target protein was investigated by binding analyses, which indicated specific binding to a double-stranded DNA hairpin construct containing a c-Jun response element, but not to a control sequence. Isolated Affibody (R) variants from the phage selection were expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity chromatography and their interaction with c-Jun was analysed. In biosensor analyses, one Affibody (R) ligand, denoted Z(cJun518) was shown to interact with immobilized c-Jun protein with an apparent dissociation constant of 5 mu M. By constructing a head-to-tail homodimeric version of Z(cJun518), its apparent affinity for c-Jun could be increased threefold, suggesting co-operativity effects in the binding to the immobilized c-Jun protein. Further characterization of the Z(cJun518) Affibody (R) molecule demonstrated, in both affinity-capture and Western-blotting experiments, its ability to interact selectively with c-Jun, even when the c-Jun target was present in a complex protein background consisting of a bacterial cell lysate.

In the present study resveratrol was coupled through a hydrolysable covalent bond with the carboxylic acid groups in porous poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) surface grafted with acrylic acid (AA). The osteogenic effect of this new scaffold was evaluated in mesenchymal cell culture and in the rat calvarial defect model. We found that the incorporation of resveratrol caused increased ALP activity of rat bone marrow stromal cells and enhanced mineralization of the cell-scaffold composites in vitro. After 8 weeks the calvarial defects implanted with resveratrol-conjugated PCL displayed a higher X-ray density than the defects implanted with control PCL. Bone-like structures, positively immunostained for bone sialoprotein, were shown to be more extensively formed in the resveratrol-conjugated PCL These results show that incorporation of resveratrol into the AA-functionalized porous PCL scaffold led to a significant increase in osteogenesis.

Experimental parts involve base bitumens from different sources, isolated bitumen waxes and commercial waxes. Asphalt concrete slabs, containing base or wax modified bitumen were prepared and tested. Binder properties were evaluated using different types of laboratory equipment, such as dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), bending beam rheometer (BBR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), as well as equipment for determining more conventional parameters. Asphalt concrete properties were evaluated at low temperatures using the tensile strain restrained specimen test (TSRST) and creep test at -25 degrees C At higher temperatures, dynamic creep testing was performed at 40 degrees C, and complex modulus tests between 0 and 20 degrees C Binder test results indicated that the magnitude and type of effect on bitumen rheology depend on the bitumen itself hype of crystallizing fraction in the bitumen and for type and amount of additive used. Adding polyethylene wax, showed no or positive effects on the rheological behaviour at low temperatures (decrease in stiffness) as well as medium and high temperatures (increase in complex modulus and decrease in phase angle). However, the corresponding positive effects could not be shown in dynamic creep testing (at 40 degrees C) of asphalt concrete mixtures containing these modified binders. Adding FT-paraffin decreased the physical hardening index (obtained using BBR) for all bitumens. Also polyethylene war and montan wax showed this effect for some bitumens. Slack wax showed a large increasing effect on physical hardening. No correlation between physical hardening index (PHI) and wax content by DSC was found in this study. Addition of commercial waxes used showed no or marginally positive influence on bitumen ageing properties for bitumens and test conditions used.

Moreover, there is a stiffening effect at medium and high temperatures (below placing temperature), indicating a certain positive effect on stability. Concerning low temperature performance, there are results indicating some negative impact on crack susceptibility at low temperatures, more by the addition of one of the waxes than by addition of the other.

Cell-office employees are most satisfied with the physical environment overall, followed by those in flex-office. However the results for cell-office are not uniformly best, since they score low with regard to the social aspects of design-related factors and, in particular on support of affinity.

Design/methodology/approach: Three different research questions are investigated. The first considers how to identify separate local housing markets, with the use of a regression-tree approach, and the second concerns when it is possible to update a price index, with a recursive regression approach. Finally, the question about seasonal adjustment is investigated. Findings: Overall, the hedonic approach is the best method to use. Moreover, the County of Stockholm is not one market in the sense that the market can be represented by only one property price index. It can be best described as a number of different sub-markets where the property prices grow differently. The results suggest that there exist at least five different price indexes in the County of Stockholm. The results also support that recursive regressions are two appropriate methods to answer the research questions. Here, the empirical analysis suggests that the parameter estimates converge relatively fast toward the estimate using all observations. Practical implications: The paper illustrates how to derive sub-markets in the construction of a price index and when to update a price index series. Originality/value: The introduction of new financial products, such as property derivatives, to the market has made the construction and quality of property price indexes more important.

Such integration requires new and efficient resource sharing mechanisms. These mechanisms need to be optimized to provide the best possible trade-off between resource efficiency and fairness. In this article, we consider a case where streaming multicast users are multiplexed together with elastic unicast users on a common time-slotted channel. We derive a system model to study the performance of various resource allocations strategies under proportional and resource fairness constraints. Fairness is directly defined in terms of the users' utilities rather than of the throughputs they are assigned to. We also describe an extension of the well-known unicast proportional fair scheduler to the multicast scenario.

The problem of estimating such second order statistics of MIMO channels, based on limited amounts of training data, is treated in this article. It is assumed that the Kronecker model holds. This implies that the channel covariance is the Kronecker product of one covariance matrix that is associated with the array and the scattering at the transmitter and one that is associated with the receive array and the scattering at the receiver. The proposed estimator uses training data from a number of signal blocks (received during independent fades of the MIMO channel) to compute the estimate. This is in contrast to methods that assume that the channel realizations are directly available, or possible to estimate almost without error. It is also demonstrated how methods that make use of the training data indirectly via channel estimates can be biased. An estimator is derived that can, in an asymptotically optimal way, use, not only the structure implied by the Kronecker assumption, but also linear structure on the transmit- and receive covariance matrices. The performance of the proposed estimator is analyzed and numerical simulations illustrate the results and also provide insight into the small sample behaviour of the proposed method.']\n",

The model consists of convective concentration and phase-field equations coupled with the Navier-Stokes equations with surface tension forces. The governing equations are nondimensionalized and an adaptive finite element method is utilized. An idealized phase diagram, surface energies, and typical dimensionless parameters are some input into the model. Important dynamics in liquid-phase sintering such as rapid wetting and motion of particles due to capillary forces are studied. Some factors that are known to significantly affect the dynamics of the sintering process such as contact angles and volume ratios are also investigated. In addition, numerical results on the motion of particles due to capillary forces were compared with an existing analytical model. Good agreement between numerical and analytical results is obtained within the validity of the analytical model.']\n",

The data consist of registrations of sound transmission loss together with concurrently collected atmospheric data at the source and receiver locations. The purpose of the analysis is to assess the accuracy of methods for transmission loss prediction in which detailed data on the local geography and atmospheric conditions are used for computation of the sound field. The results indicate that such sound propagation predictions are accurate and reproduce observed variations in the sound level as function of time in a realistic way. The results further illustrate that the atmospheric model must include a description of turbulence effects to ensure predicted noise levels to remain realistically high during periods of sound shadow.

      "[\"A nonlinear rubber material model is presented, where influences of frequency and dynamic amplitude are taken into account through fractional order viscoelasticity and plasticity, respectively. The problem of simultaneously modeling elastic, viscoelastic, and friction contributions is removed by additively splitting them. Due to the fractional order representation mainly, the number of parameters of the model remains low, rendering an easy fitting of the values from tests on material samples. The proposed model is implemented in a general-purpose finite element (FE) code. Since commercial FE codes do not contain any suitable constitutive model that represents the full dynamic behavior of rubber compounds (including frequency and amplitude dependent effects), a simple approach is used based on the idea of adding stress contributions from simple constitutive models: a mesh overlay technique, whose basic idea is to create a different FE model for each material definition (fractional derivative viscoelastic and elastoplastic), all with identical meshes but with different material definition, and sharing the same nodes. Fractional-derivative viscoelasticity is implemented through user routines and the algorithm for that purpose is described, while available von Mises' elastoplastic models are adopted to take rate-independent effects into account. Satisfactory results are obtained when comparing the model results with tests carried out in two rubber bushings at a frequency range up to 500 Hz, showing the ability of the material model to accurately describe the complex dynamic behavior of carbon-black filled rubber compounds.\"]\n",

The induced charges are assumed to be located along the centerline of the slender body. By enforcing the boundary conditions at the interfaces of the two dielectrics, an integral equations system is obtained with the induced charge densities as unknowns. Based on the calculated induced charge densities, expressions to calculate the DEP force and torque are obtained. The calculated induced charge density of a prolate ellipsoid under a uniform electric field is compared with the analytic solution and an excellent agreement is achieved. The smaller the slenderness (the ratio of maximum radius to length of the slender body), the smaller the error is. The DEP force that a prolate ellipsoid experiences in a general electric field is numerically calculated and compared with the results obtained by the commonly accepted effective dipole moment method. The current model is expected to possess higher accuracy than the effective dipole moment method and to demand less calculation work than the Maxwell stress tensor method.']\n",

      "['In terms of the Sustainable development for polymeric materials the recovery of plastic waste by means of mechanical recycling is a favorable technique. The largest part of the collected plastic municipal solid waste fraction consists of packaging materials, e.g., polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene. A major drawback to the increased use of recycled polymers is the lack of knowledge about the property changes and the overall quality of the recyclates, e.g., the degree of degradation, mixing, and contamination. This article presents a test protocol for description of the mechanical, physical, and chemical property changes during recycling and service life by combining several reprocessing cycles and thermo-oxidation. The test protocol was designed to mimic the degradation mechanisms potentially occurring in the materials during the service life and the reprocessing. Virgin PP and HDPE were multiply processed by injection molding. Service life of plastic materials was modeled by accelerated thermal degradation of one time processed materials. Tensile testing, MFR, HT-SEC, DSC, FTIR, and SEM were used to analyze material changes. In parallel, a set of industrially recycled PP and HDPE were also subjected to the same analyses. The results proved that recycled plastics maintain the majority of the material properties even when reprocessed several times. It was demonstrated that the mechanical and thermal properties of PP and HDPE were preserved also after several reprocessing steps. Initiation of degradation was observed for PP but not for HDPE. A decrease in M of PP from 240,000 to 190,000 (six times reprocessed) was established, this corresponds to an increase in MFR from 8 to 18 g/10 min. By FTIR, it was shown that the carbonyl index increased. The loss of stabilizers affects the properties of the final product. In comparison, industrially recycled PP and HDPE presented to some extent poorer mechanical properties than the materials Subjected to model recycling.']\n",

Thermo-mechanical degradation under repeated extrusion induces chain scission reactions in PET, which result in a dramatic loss in the deformation capabilities and an increase in the fluidity of the polymer under reprocessing, reducing its recycling possibilities after four extrusion cycles. Multiple reprocessing severely affects the storage modulus and the microstructure of recycled PET, both in the amorphous and crystalline regions. Multimodal melting behavior is observed for reprocessed PET, indicating heterogeneous and segregated crystalline regions. A deconvolution procedure has been applied to individually characterize each crystalline population in terms of lamellar thickness distribution and partial crystallinity. Thermal analysis techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic-mechanical analysis (DMA) have proved to be suitable techniques for the quality assessment of recycled PET, giving unequivocal information about its degree of degradation compared to the common technological measurements of melt-mass flow rate (MFR) or oxidative stability (T-OX).']\n",

The cellulose fibres in the composites gave a more easily colonized surface mainly attributed to water uptake. In the short term perspective, the water uptake offered better conditions for biofilm adhesion, and in the longer perspective the exposure to microorganisms also resulted in mechanical degradation, followed by biodegradation of cellulose.

Tracheostomy tubes made of silicone rubber were exposed to in vivo biofilm environments in clinical tests for periods of 7, 3, and 6 months. The chemical degradation was monitored by MALDI-TOF MS, ATR-FTI.R, and FE-SEM. In addition, the physical changes were monitored by contact angle and hardness measurements. Cyclic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was detected on the surfaces of new (unaged) silicones. On the surfaces of the in vivo samples new compounds, presumably linear methyl-hydroxyl-terminated PDMS, were detected in addition to cyclic PDMS. These compounds may be formed as a result of the hydrolysis of linear dimethyl terminated PDMS, which is also present in the silicone rubber. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that hydrolysis had indeed occurred during the in vivo exposure, since Si-OH groups were detected. Furthermore, significant changes in the topography were detected by FE-SEM, indicating the initiation of degradation. No significant changes in the contact angle of the in vivo used samples were observed, but this information may be shielded by the fact that biofilm may remain on the surface, despite the thorough cleaning before the analysis. It is also possible that the surface hydrophobicity was recovered by the diffusion of linear low-molecular-weight compounds from the bulk.']\n",

The degradation product patterns were determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).

However, somewhat surprisingly, the pH of the aging medium decreased much faster in the case of PLLA/PDLA stereocomplex. In accordance, the ESI-MS results showed that hydrolysis of PLLA/PDLA resulted in shorter and more acidic degradation products. This could be explained by the increased intermolecular crystallization clue to stereocomplexation, which results in an increased number of tie chains.

      "['Wave intensity analysis is a concept providing information about the interaction of the heart and the vascular system. Originally, the technique was invasive. Since then new noninvasive methods have been developed. A recently developed ultrasound technique to estimate tissue motion and deformation is speckle-tracking echocardiography. Speckle tracking-based techniques allow for accurate measurement of movement and deformation variables in the arterial wall in both the radial and the longitudinal direction. The aim of this study was to test if speckle tracking-derived deformation data could be used as input for wave intensity calculations. The new concept was to approximate changes of flow and pressure by deformation changes of the arterial wall in longitudinal and radial directions. Flow changes (dU/dt) were approximated by strain rate (sr, 1/s) of the arterial wall in the longitudinal direction, whereas pressure changes (dP/dt) were approximated by sign reversed strain rate (1/s) in the arterial wall in the radial direction. To validate the new concept, a comparison between the newly developed Wave Intensity Wall Analysis (WIWA) algorithm and a commonly used and validated wave intensity system (SSD-5500, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) was performed. The studied population consisted of ten healthy individuals (three women, seven men) and ten patients (all men) with coronary artery disease. The present validation study indicates that the mechanical properties of the arterial wall, as measured by a speckle tracking-based technique are a possible input for wave intensity calculations. The study demonstrates good visual agreement between the two systems and the time interval between the two positive peaks (W1-W2) measured by the Aloka system and the WIWA system correlated for the total group (r = 0.595, P &lt; 0.001).

The tubes were exposed to the local environment, in the trachea for 3 and 6 months and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Results: All tubes revealed severe surface changes. No significant differences were established after 3 or 6 months of exposure between the various materials. The changes had progressed significantly after this period, compared to previously reported changes after 30 days of exposure. The results from all analyzing techniques correlated well. Conclusions: All tubes, exposed in the trachea for 3-6 months, revealed major degradation and changes in the surface of the material. Polymeric tracheostomy tubes should be changed before the end of 3 months of clinical use.']\n",

The relationship of these estimates to pregnancy and intent to quit smoking was also investigated. Methods: Over a two-week period, eighty women, selected to constitute four subgroups formed by pregnant vs. non-pregnant and trying vs. not trying to quit smoking, rated times at which they would expect smoking-related consequences to occur given continuing or quitting smoking. Results: Somatic health consequences were estimated to occur later than consequences related to mood and social relations. All consequences were estimated to occur later given quitting smoking. Pregnancy had an effect on the estimated time that consequences would occur, with pregnant women estimating earlier occurrence of consequences related to mood and social relations than non-pregnant women did. Conclusion: Health messages should stress consequences for somatic health in quitting smoking, since outcomes later in time might have too low a value to exert a positive effect on decisions to quit smoking.']\n",

Materials and Methods: The size of 12 polyp phantoms was assessed in tandem colonoscopies carried out by 7 endoscopists differing in years of clinical endoscopical experience. The endoscopists measured, with (n=5) or without (n=2) the aid of open forceps, the largest diameter of 12 polyp phantoms. Measurements in two independent trials were compared with the gold standard-size assessed at The Department Of Production Engineering, The Royal Institute of Technology. Results: In tandem trials, 99.4% (167/168) of the measurements underscored the gold standard size. In the 1st trial, the size in all 84 measurements was underestimated by -40% (range -34% to -45%) and in the 2nd trial the size in 83 of the 84 measurements was underestimated by -34% (range -24% to -42%). Neither the age of the participant, nor the years of experience with clinical endoscopy improved the results obtained. The participants significantly underestimated larger devices (>= 20 mm) whereas the smallest \"polyps\" were also underestimated, but with a lower degree of inaccuracy. The absolute difference between the golden standard size and the mean of all measurements performed on each polyp in 167 out of 168 measurements followed a regular downward trend. The volume of the devices was one of the confounding factors in size assessment. When compared to the gold standard size, the larger the \"polyp\" size, the higher the degree of underestimation. This may be crucial considering that the risk for colorectal adenomas to shelter an invasive growth is 46%, for adenomas measuring >= 2 cm, a limit accepted as a guideline worldwide for the management of patients with large colorectal polyps. Conclusion: Considering the clinical implications of the results obtained, the possibility of developing a method that would allow the assessment of the true size of polyps in clinical colonoscopy, is being explored.']\n",

Policy measures that stimulate more effective use of the existing network, such as variable road pricing, are therefore becoming increasingly popular among policy makers and citizens. These measures are often aimed at changing the temporal distribution of traffic. Yet transportation models taking departure time choice into account are rare. This paper describes the implementation of an urban transportation application for Stockholm, which includes departure time choice, mode choice and time dependent network assignment. Through iterations between demand and supply the objective of the transportation model is to forecast effects of congestion charges, intelligent transport systems and infrastructure investments on departure time choice. The complexity of large-scale departure time choice modelling and dynamic traffic assignment is high, which results in very long run times. Therefore, research on how to increase model efficiency is needed. This paper describes choices made in the implementation for a more efficient model.']\n",

Using matrix calibration, effects on the non-observed link flows and travel times are extrapolated, enabling us to calculate the social value of changes in travel times and travel costs. Impacts on traffic safety and emissions are calculated using standard Swedish CBA relationships.

      "['In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness that travel time reliability, apart from expected travel time, is an important component of cost-benefit analysis, especially during congested traffic conditions. A common measure of travel time reliability is standard deviation, and it has been shown that this is a theoretically sound measure under scheduling constraints, provided that the mean lateness factor is known. Hence, in applied cost-benefit analyses, one will need both the standard deviation and the mean lateness factor. These analyses would be particularly simple if the mean lateness were constant across time of day and for different routes chosen. A study was done to explore how the mean lateness varies and how its variations can be approximated. With the use of travel time measurements on individual links, it is shown how mean lateness varies considerably across time and space. It is shown that mean lateness exhibits a time-varying pattern depending on the characteristics of congestion on the link. It is also shown that the location of the link in the network is a significant determinant. The resulting model for mean lateness represents a considerable improvement over existing practice, where the mean lateness is implicitly assumed constant, yet a large portion of its variation remains unexplained. The model is useful for informing future research but is of less value for predicting the mean lateness in broad applied settings.']\n",

Link closures may have different economic and societal consequences depending on in which regions they occur (regional importance), and users may be affected differently depending on where they travel (regional exposure). In this paper we investigate in what way these geographical disparities depend on the road network structure and travel patterns. We propose aggregate supply-side (link redundancy, network scale, road density, population density) and demand-side (user travel time, traffic load) indicators and combine them in statistical regression models. Using the Swedish road network as a case study, we find that regional importance is largely determined by the network structure and the average traffic load in the region, whereas regional exposure is largely determined by the network structure and the average user travel time. Our findings show that the long-term vulnerability disparities stem from fundamental properties of the transport system and the population densities. Quantitatively, they show how vulnerability depends on different variables, which is of interest for robust network design.']\n",

The result indicates that disutility of unexpected delay depends on the scheduled deviation from preferred arrival time.

Focusing on the quantitative parts of a congestion pricing system with link tolls, the problem involves finding the number of toll links, the link toll locations and their corresponding toll level and schedule. In this paper, we develop and evaluate methods for finding the most efficient design for a congestion pricing scheme in a road network model with elastic demand. The design efficiency is measured by the net social surplus, which is computed as the difference between the social surplus and the collection costs (i.e. setup and operational costs) of the congestion pricing system. The problem of finding such a scheme is stated as a combinatorial bi-level optimization problem. At the upper level, we maximize the net social surplus and at the lower level we solve a user equilibrium problem with elastic demand, given the toll locations and toll levels, to simulate the user response. We modify a known heuristic procedure for finding the optimal locations and toll levels given a fixed number of tolls to locate, to find the optimal number of toll facilities as well. A new heuristic procedure, based on repeated solutions of a continuous approximation of the combinatorial problem is also presented. Numerical results for two small test networks are presented. Both methods perform satisfactorily on the two networks. Comparing the two methods, we find that the continuous approximation procedure is the one which shows the best results.']\n",

Minimizing buffer variance is also important because it affects the modularity of routers and network interfaces. A realistic case study exhibits 62.8% reduction of total buffers, 84.3% reduction of total latency, and 94.4% reduction on the sum of variances of buffers.

Between distributed agents on different levels, monitoring communication is required to exchange information, which forms a prioritized traffic class over data traffic. The paper explains the common monitoring operations in SoCs, and categorizes them into different types of functionality and various granularities. Requirements for on-chip interconnections to support the monitoring communication are outlined. Baseline architecture with best-effort service, time division multiple access (TDMA) and two types of physically separate interconnections are discussed and compared, both theoretically and quantitatively on a Network-on-Chip (NoC)-based platform. The simulation uses power estimation of 65 nm technology and NoC microbenchmarks as traffic traces. The evaluation points out the benefits and issues of each interconnection alternative. In particular, hierarchical monitoring networks are the most suitable alternative, which decouple the monitoring communication from data traffic, provide the highest energy efficiency with simple switching, and enable flexible reconfiguration to tradeoff power and performance.']\n",

      "['Good coupling of lower hybrid (LH) waves has been demonstrated in different H-mode scenarios in JET, at high triangularity (delta similar to 0.4) and at large distance between the last closed flux surface and the LH launcher ( up to 15 cm). Local gas injection of D-2 in the region magnetically connected to the LH launcher is used for increasing the local density in the scrape-off layer ( SOL). Reciprocating Langmuir probe measurements magnetically connected to the LH launcher indicate that the electron density profile flattens in the far SOL during gas injection and LH power application. Some degradation in normalized H-mode confinement, as given by the H98(gamma,2)-factor, could be observed at high gas injection rates in these scenarios, but this was rather due to total gas injection and not specifically to the local gas puffing used for LH coupling. Furthermore, experiments carried out in L-mode plasmas in order to evaluate the effect on the LH current drive efficiency, when using local gas injection to improve the coupling, indicate only a small degradation (Delta I-LH/I-LH similar to 15%). This effect is largely compensated by the improvement in coupling and thus increase in coupled power when using gas puffing.']\n",

In particular, the toroidal rotation profiles in plasmas heated by ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) waves and lower hybrid (LH) waves have been analysed. It is the first time that rotation profiles in JET plasmas with LH waves have been measured in dedicated discharges. It is found that the toroidal plasma rotation in the outer region of the plasmas is in the co-current direction irrespective of the heating scenario. An interesting feature is that the toroidal rotation profile appears to be hollow in many discharges at low plasma current, but a low current in itself does not seem to be a sufficient condition for finding such profiles. Fast ion transport and finite orbit width effects are mechanisms that could explain hollow rotation profiles. This possibility has been investigated by numerical simulations of the torque on the bulk plasma due to fast ICRF accelerated ions. The obtained torque is used in a transport equation for the toroidal momentum density to estimate the effect on the thermal bulk plasma rotation profile.']\n",

Threshold and stiffness have been compared with linear and nonlinear predictions of the gyrokinetic code GS2.

A dependence of the losses on MHD mode amplitude was deduced from the experimental data. A study of various plasma scenarios has shown that a significant redistribution of the fast ions happens during changes in the profile of the safety factor from shear-reversed to monotonic. Significant changes in the losses of ICRH accelerated protons were found to be associated with L-H confinement transitions in plasmas. After an L-H transition, an abrupt decrease in the ICRH proton losses was observed. In plasmas with an internal transport barrier, the loss of ICRH accelerated ions was found to increase as the barrier forms. Further results concerning fast ion losses were obtained during JET experiments in which the magnitude of the TF ripple was varied. The ripple losses of fusion products appear similar to classical losses, and are in agreement with modelling.']\n",

The simulations were carried out using the Monte Carlo guiding-centre orbit-following code ASCOT. The FIs were found very effective in ameliorating the detrimental effects of the toroidal ripple: the fast ion wall loads are reduced practically to their negligible axisymmetric level. The thermonuclear alpha particles overwhelmingly dominate the wall power flux. In scenario-4 practically all the power goes to the limiters, while in scenario-2 the load is fairly evenly divided between the divertor and the limiter, with hardly any power flux to other components in the first wall. This is opposite to earlier results, where hot spots were observed with 2D wall (Tobita et al 2003 Fusion Eng. Des. 65 561-8). In contrast, uncompensated ripple leads to unacceptable peak power fluxes of 0.5 MW m(-2) in scenario-2 and 1 MW m(-2) in scenario-4, with practically all power hitting the limiters and substantial flux arriving even at the unprotected first wall components. The local TBM structures were found to perturb the magnetic field structure globally and lead to increased wall loads. However, the TBM simulation results overestimate the TBM contribution due to an over-simplification in the vacuum field. Therefore the TBM results should be considered as an upper limit.']\n",

To show the potential and robustness of this pressure-assisted deposition technique, different sample solutions known to cause severe problems or to be even impossible to print with conventional microarrayers were accurately printed. The samples included 200 mg mL(-1) human serum albumin, highly concentrated sticky cell adhesion proteins, pure high-salt cell-lysis buffer, pure DMSO, and a suspension of 5-mu m polystyrene beads. Additionally, a water-immiscible liquid fluorocarbon, which was shown not to affect the functionality of the capture molecules, was employed as a lid to reduce evaporation during microarray printing. The fluorocarbon liquid lid was shown to circumvent hydrolysis of water-sensitive activated surfaces during long-term deposition procedures.']\n",

Although platforms are improving at the rate of Moore's Law, thereby reducing the sequencing costs by a factor of two or three each year, we find ourselves at a point in history where individual genomes are starting to appear but where the cost is still too high for routine sequencing of whole genomes. These needs will be met by miniaturized and parallelized platforms that allow a lower sample and template consumption thereby increasing speed and reducing costs.

Other parts of the food system contribute carbon dioxide emissions that emanate from the use of fossil fuels in transportation, processing, retailing, storage, and preparation. Food items differ substantially when GHG emissions are calculated from farm to table. A recent study of approximate to 20 items sold in Sweden showed a span of 0.4 to 30 kg CO2 equivalents/kg edible product. For protein-rich food, such as legumes, meat, fish, cheese, and eggs, the difference is a factor of 30 with the lowest emissions per kilogram for legumes, poultry, and eggs and the highest for beef, cheese, and pork. Large emissions for ruminants are explained mainly by methane emissions from enteric fermentation. For vegetables and fruits, emissions usually are &lt;= 2.5 kg CO2 equivalents/kg product, even if there is a high degree of processing and substantial transportation. Products transported by plane are an exception because emissions may be as large as for certain meats. Emissions from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as potatoes, pasta, and wheat, are &lt;1.1 kg/kg edible food. We suggest that changes in the diet toward more plant-based foods, toward meat from animals with little enteric fermentation, and toward foods processed in an energy-efficient manner offer an interesting and little explored area for mitigating climate change.']\n",

      "['Municipal solid waste (MSW) is not only a societal problem addressed with environmental impact, it is also a resource that can be used for energy supply. In Northern Europe combustion of MSW ( incineration with energy recovery) in combination with district heating systems is quite common. In Sweden, about 47% of the household waste is treated by incineration with energy recovery. Most incineration plants are CHP, summing up to 0.3% of the total electricity generation. MSW is to a high extent a renewable fuel, but plastic, rubber etc. can amount to 50% of the carbon content in the waste. Recycling of plastic is in general environmentally favourable in comparison to landfill disposal or incineration. However, some plastic types are not possible to recycle and some plastic is of such low quality that it is not suitable for recycling. This paper focuses on the non-renewable and non-recyclable plastic in MSW. A CO2 assessment has been made for non-recyclable plastic where incineration with energy recovery has been compared to landfill disposal. In the assessment, consideration has been taken of alternative fuel in the incinerator, emissions from waste treatment and avoided emissions from heat and power supply. For landfill disposal of plastic the emissions of CO2 amounts to 253 g kg(-1) plastic. For incineration, depending on different discrete choices, the results vary from -673 g kg(-1) to 4605 g kg(-1). Results indicate that for typical Swedish and European conditions, incineration of plastics has net emissions of greenhouse gases. These emissions are also in general higher for incineration than for landfill disposal. However in situations where plastics are incinerated with high efficiency and high electricity to heat ratios, and the heat and the electricity from incineration of plastics are replacing heat and electricity in non-combined heat and power plants based on fossil fuels, incineration of plastics can give a net negative contribution of greenhouse gases. The results suggest that efforts should be made to increase recycling of plastics, direct incineration of plastics in places where it can be combusted with high efficiency and high electricity-to-heat ratios where it is replacing fossil fuels, and reconsider the present policies of avoiding landfill disposal of plastics.']\n",

In the following step the uses of ethanol for hydrogen production by steam reforming is analyzed and some comparison with natural gas steam reforming is performed. The sugar cane industry in Brazil, in a near future, in the hydrogen era, could be modified according to our purpose, since besides the production of sugar, and ethylic and anhydric alcohol, Brazilian sugar cane industry will also be able to produce biohydrogen. Fuel cells appear like a promising technology for energy generation. Among several technologies in the present, the PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is the most appropriate for vehicles application, because it combines durability, high power density, high efficiency, good response and it works at relatively low temperatures. Besides that it is easy to turn it on and off and it is able to support present vibration in vehicles. A PEMFC's problem is the need of noble catalysts like platinum. Another problem is that CO needs to be in low concentration, requiring a more clean hydrogen to avoid fuel cell deterioration. One part of this paper was developed in Stockholm, where there are some buses within the CUTE (clean urban transport for Europe) project that has been in operation with FC since January 2004.

This class of objects is thought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at a high Eddington ratio. The radio loudness and variability of the compact radio core indicate the presence of a relativistic jet. Quasi-simultaneous radio/optical/X-ray and gamma-ray observations are presented. Both radio and gamma-ray emissions (observed over five months) are strongly variable. The simultaneous optical and X-ray data from Swift show a blue continuum attributed to the accretion disk and a hard X-ray spectrum attributed to the jet. The resulting broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) and, in particular, the gamma-ray spectrum measured by Fermi are similar to those of more powerful Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). A comparison of the radio and gamma-ray characteristics of PMN J0948+0022 with the other blazars detected by LAT shows that this source has a relatively low radio and gamma-ray power with respect to other FSRQs.

The coflow and wall temperature are equal and a temperature dependent viscosity according to Sutherland-™s law is used. The inlet Reynolds and Mach numbers are equal in all these cases. The influence of the varying temperature on the development and jet growth is studied as well as turbulence and scalar statistics. The varying density affects the turbulence structures of the jets. Smaller turbulence scales are present in the warm jet than in the isothermal and cold jet and consequently the scale separation between the inner and outer shear layer is larger. In addition, a cold jet in a warm coflow at a higher inlet Reynolds number was also simulated. Although the domain length is somewhat limited, the growth rate and the turbulence statistics indicate approximate self-similarity in the fully turbulent region. The use of van Driest scaling leads to a collapse of all mean velocity profiles in the near-wall region. Taking into account the varying density by using semilocal scaling of turbulent stresses and fluctuations does not completely eliminate differences, indicating the influence of mean density variations on normalized turbulence statistics. Temperature and passive scalar dissipation rates and time scales have been computed since these are important for combustion models. Except for very near the wall, the dissipation time scales are rather similar in all cases and fairly constant in the outer region.']\n",

One dynamic model and one non-dynamic model are proposed. The non-dynamic model represents a computationally efficient subgrid scale (SGS) stress model, whereas the dynamic model is the most accurate. The models are validated through large eddy simulations (LESs) of spanwise and streamwise rotating channel flow and are compared with the standard and dynamic Smagorinsky models. The proposed explicit dependence on the system rotation improves the description of the mean velocity profiles and the turbulent kinetic energy at high rotation rates. Comparison with the dynamic Smagorinsky model shows that not using the eddy-viscosity assumption improves the description of both the Reynolds stress anisotropy and the SGS stress anisotropy. LESs of rotating channel flow at Re-tau = 950 have been carried out as well. These reveal some significant Reynolds number influences on the turbulence statistics. LESs of non-rotating turbulent channel flow at Re-tau = 950 show that the new explicit model especially at coarse resolutions significantly better predicts the mean velocity, wall shear and Reynolds stresses than the dynamic Smagorinsky model, which is probably the result of a better prediction of the anisotropy of the subgrid dissipation.']\n",

The layer has to be both thick enough to protect the information and even enough for the information to be read through it optically. Furthermore, it is preferred not to cover the hole in the center of the disk. Spin coating is a candidate method for the production of these layers in a rapid reproduction process. When dispensing is performed off-center (in order not to cover the hole), a new complication appears, namely the formation of a slope toward the inner rim of the liquid film. Here, fundamental limitations for achieving even films in this system and ways to overcome the difficulties by manipulation of the process are studied. A mathematical model for this particular case of spin coating is obtained and validated by comparison with experiments made in industrial equipment aiming at producing BDs. The model agrees well with the experimental data. The model is then used to show that cover layers that fulfil the Blu-Ray specification are very difficult to produce with the spin-coating technique. Manipulation by inline curing and surface shear is added to the model and the results show that it is considerably easier to meet the BD specification when utilizing the manipulation.']\n",

Co was found to be incorporated into the Fe2O3 phase after calcination, at least for the iron-rich samples, while no evidence of Fe incorporated into Co3O4 was found. Upon reduction, most probably FeCo alloys were formed in the iron-rich bimetallic samples. The degree of reduction of the catalysts showed a non-linear behavior with respect to the Fe:Co ratio, but it is obvious that Co increases the reducibility of Fe. Alloying Co with small/moderate amounts of Fe improved the FT activity compared to the 100% Co catalyst at low conversion levels. Alloying Fe with small/moderate amounts of Co lowered the FT activity, but increased the relative water-gas-shift (WGS) activity compared to the 100% Fe catalyst. However, the overall WGS activity was very low for all catalysts, even with external water addition to the feed, resulting in low FT productivities (per gram catalyst) due to the low partial pressure of H-2. A higher Fe:Co ratio in the bimetallic catalyst generally resulted in higher relative WGS activity, but did not lower the H-2/CO usage ratio to the desired value of 1.0. For the Fe-containing catalysts, the space-time yield of hydrocarbons (HCs) decreased with increasing partial pressure of water or reduced space velocity, indicating an inhibition of water on the FT activity, most often resulting in low FT productivity under the conditions with highest relative WGS activity (usage ratios closest to the inlet H-2/CO ratio). Moreover, the co-impregnation technique resulted in a surface enrichment of Fe, at least for the Co-rich samples, covering the Co sites. For the bimetallic catalysts, both FT and WGS activities rapidly declined at high partial pressure of water due to deactivation by oxidation and sintering. However, the results indicate that WGS and FT proceeded over sites of different nature in the bimetallic catalysts.The bimetallic catalysts showed essentially no synergy effects with respect to HC selectivities and olefin/paraffin ratios, which partly can be explained by the use of a sub-stoichiometric H-2/CO ratio as feed. The higher the Fe content, the lower were the C5+ selectivity and C-3 olefin/paraffin ratio. Water addition increased the C5+ selectivity and C-3 Olefin/paraffin ratio and reduced the CH4 selectivity.']\n",

In this study, olive kernels were used as a solid biofuel, and high temperature steam gasification (HTSG) was investigated, in the fixed bed unit at KTH Sweden, with regard to hydrogen maximization in the produced gasification gas. Experiments were carried out in a temperature range of 750-1050 degrees C, with steam as the gasifying agent. The behaviour of olive kernels, under residence times from 120 up to 960 s, has been studied.

In base of the experimental results, the influence of oxygen concentration and oxidizer temperature on total mass conversion, the release of fuel nitrogen and the fraction of fuel nitrogen that is oxidized to NOx, is discussed. For oxygen concentration 5-21%, the rate of the thermochemical conversion was shown to be almost independent oxygen concentration when oxidant temperatures of 1073-1273 K were used. The opposite was true for an oxidant temperature of 873 K. Thus there appears to be an oxidant temperature above which devolatilisation is controlled by convective heat transfer rather than reaction. Further it was shown that the release of fuel nitrogen was promoted by an increased oxygen concentration (from 5% to 21% at 1273 K) and an increase of oxidant temperature (from 1073 K to 1273 K at 21% oxygen). An estimate of the devolatilisation of nitrogen from the measured pellet temperature indicated that the devolatilisation of nitrogen is significantly delayed with respect to other components. In fact, during the very initial part of the thermochemical conversion, most released nitrogen appeared to follow the route via char rather than via devolatilisation. Favorable conditions for No reduction thanks to a prompt devolatilisation contemporarily to a release of fuel nitrogen via the char route was believed to be one of the explanation for the evidenced low ratios between NOx emissions and fuel nitrogen released, particularly in the beginning of the experiment. The fact that the amount of released fuel nitrogen that is oxidized to NOx was shown to decrease with increasing oxidant temperatures from 1073 K to 1273 K supports this interpretation, though a higher temperature of the oxidant creates higher devolatilisation rates.\"]\n",

Whether hydrocarbons can also be produced from abiogenic precursor molecules under the high-pressure, high-temperature conditions characteristic of the upper mantle remains an open question. It has been proposed that hydrocarbons generated in the upper mantle could be transported through deep faults to shallower regions in the Earth's crust, and contribute to petroleum reserves(4,5). Here we use in situ Raman spectroscopy in laser-heated diamond anvil cells to monitor the chemical reactivity of methane and ethane under upper-mantle conditions. We show that when methane is exposed to pressures higher than 2 GPa, and to temperatures in the range of 1,000-1,500 K, it partially reacts to form saturated hydrocarbons containing 2-4 carbons (ethane, propane and butane) and molecular hydrogen and graphite. Conversely, exposure of ethane to similar conditions results in the production of methane, suggesting that the synthesis of saturated hydrocarbons is reversible.

The program can manage and analyse travel time measurements in a distributed database server where both online and historical traffic information are saved. Meanwhile, several existing travel time estimation algorithms are implemented in the travel time analysis program, and are evaluated using four months of AVI data collected in the urban streets and arterials of and near the Stockholm downtown area. The advantages and disadvantages of those algorithms are also analysed using the highly noisy travel time measurements collected under the urban context. In addition, the authors have also evaluated a common statistical median filtering approach and suggested some modifications for AVI data estimation. In general, all these algorithms have the potential to be applied for real daily travel time estimation and the statistical median filter with modifications has been suggested for historical travel time estimation in real application. Finally, the authors point out an essential problem in travel time estimation and suggest a direction that may have the potential to improve the online traffic information quality.']\n",

Ventilation control is essential for the operation of a mine in terms of safety (CO and NO, regulation) and energy optimization. We first discuss a novel regulation architecture, highlighting the interest for a model-based control approach and the use of distributed sensing capabilities thanks to a wireless sensor network (WSN). We propose a new model for underground ventilation. The main components of the system dynamics are described with time-delays, transmission errors, energy losses and concentration profiles. Two different model-based control approaches, which can embody the complex dynamics of the system, are proposed. The first one resorts to a nonlinear model predictive control strategy (receding horizon) and aims to energy minimization, thanks to a continuous operation of the fans. The second one, based on a hybrid description of the model and fans operation, provides automatic verification of the wireless control thanks to abstraction techniques. These control strategies are compared with simulations, in terms of regulation efficiency, energy consumption and the need for computational capabilities. The industrial case description and control strategies open new vistas for the development of global system approaches that allow for the optimization of energy consumption of complex large-scale systems.']\n",

Whereas particularly Swedish operators prefer AON, this may not be the case for operators in other countries. The choice depends on a combination of technical requirements, practical constraints, business models, and cost. Due to the increasing importance of reliable access to the network services, connection availability is becoming one of the most crucial issues for access networks. which should be reflected in the network owner's architecture decision. In many cases protection against failures is realized by adding backup resources. However, there is a trade off between the cost of protection and the level of service reliability since improving reliability performance by duplication of network resources (and capital expenditures CAPEX) may be too expensive. In this paper we present the evolution of fiber access networks and compare reliability performance in relation to investment and management cost for some representative cases. We consider both standard and novel architectures for deployment in both sparsely and densely populated areas. While some recent works focused on PON protection schemes with reduced CAPEX the current and future effort should be put on minimizing the operational expenditures (OPEX) during the access network lifetime.\"]\n",

However, it is also one of the critical user cases, since,  besides the vehicle penetration loss, the received signal quality is  strongly affected by the high mobility of the users, which is  accompanied by temporary shadowing and fast fading. On the other hand,  mobility can be also beneficial thanks to the bursty character of DVB-H  transmissions, as additional repair data can be sent in the time  intervals between original service bursts in order to hide the coverage  discontinuities from the users' perception. In this way, users which  miss the original transmission have more chances to receive the  information correctly. By managing the amount of repair data the network  operator can trade system capacity and network latency for improved  vehicular user satisfaction in a DVB-H network with imperfect coverage  of the service area (as perceived by the vehicular users). To illustrate  the potential of this approach, we evaluate the mentioned trade-off in a  DVB-H system dimensioned for pedestrian outdoor users, for both  streaming and filecasting services. To enable an easy and efficient  implementation of the repair mechanisms, we adopt application layer  forward error correction (FEC), as it can provide a multi-burst  protection of the transmission.\"]\n",

Operators are challenged by the fact that revenues from mobile roadband are limited, just a few per cent of ARPU, and thus not compensating for declining voice revenues, creating a so called \"revenue gap\". Concurrently, mobile broadband dominates the traffic, set to grow strongly. In this paper we analyze the potential of different strategies for operators to reduce or bridge the revenue gap. The main options are to reduce network costs, to increase access prices and to exploit new revenue streams. The focus in the paper is on cost &amp; capacity challenges and solutions in the network domain.</p><p>Operators can cooperate and share sites and spectrum, which could be combined with off-loading heavy traffic to less costly local networks. In the network analysis we illustrate the cost impacts of different levels of demand, re-use of existing base station sites, sharing of base stations and spectrum and deployment of a denser network. A sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact on total revenues if access prices are increased, whether new types of services generate additional revenues, and if it fills the revenue gap. Our conclusion is that the different technical options to reduce the revenue gap can be linked to business strategies that include cooperation with both other operators as well as with non-telecom actors. Hence, innovations in the business domain enable technical solutions to be better or fully exploited.']\n",

To meet the redundancy requirements of telecom signaling traffic, SCTP includes a failover mechanism that enables rerouting of traffic from an unreachable network path to a backup path. However, the recommendations provided by IETF on how to configure the SCTP failover mechanism to meet telecom signaling requirements are kept quite general and leave much of the tuning to the telecom equipment vendor and/or operator. Several works by us and others have been carried out to study the effect of different SCTP parameters on the failover performance. The main contribution of this paper is that it gives a coherent treatment of how to configure the SCTP failover mechanism for carrier-grade telephony signaling, and provides practically usable configuration recommendations. The paper also discusses an alternate or complementary way of optimizing the SCTP failover mechanism by relaxing the exponential backoff that foregoes a retransmission timeout in SCTP.

Deliberate physical-layer attacks, such as high-powered jamming, can seriously degrade network performance and must be dealt with efficiently. While most approaches are focused on the developing fast detection and reaction mechanisms triggered in case of an attack, we propose a novel approach to help deal with these issues in the network planning and provisioning process as a prevention mechanism. Namely, we propose to route lightpaths in such a way as to minimize the potential damage caused by various physical-layer attacks. We present a new objective criterion for the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, which we call the maximum Lightpath Attack Radius (maxLAR), and formulate the routing subproblem as an integer linear program (ILP). We test it on small networks to get an insight into its complexity and compare it to a formulation that minimizes congestion. Results indicate that our formulation achieves significantly better results for the maxLAR while obtaining near-optimal or optimal congestion in all cases. For larger networks, we propose a tabu search algorithm for attack-aware lightpath routing, in combination with an existing graph-coloring algorithm for wavelength assignment. Testing and comparing with existing approaches from literature indicate its superiority with respect to the maxLAR and average lightpath load, albeit at the expense of somewhat higher congestion. However, this is justified with the obtained improvement in network security.']\n",

However, in a transparent WDM network the optical signal transmitted from a source to a destination node might be degraded due to physical layer impairments induced by transmission through optical fibers and components. Several Impairment Constraint Based Routing (ICBR) algorithms have been proposed to consider physical layer impairments during the connection-provisioning phase in order to prevent selecting a lightpath with poor signal quality. However, these algorithms support only a single quality of transmission threshold for all connection requests, while next generation networks and the future Internet are expected to support a variety of services with potentially disparate QoS requirements. In this paper, we propose the use of bit error rate (BER) as a differentiation of service parameter for connection requests in optical WDM networks. This is achieved through the use of ICBR, whereby various BER thresholds are set depending on the QoS requirements for accepting/blocking the connection requests during the connection-provisioning phase. The evaluation results reveal that significant network performance improvement in terms of connection blocking can be achieved, compared to non-differentiated conventional routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) and ICBR algorithms.']\n",

Meanwhile, because of the growing demand for reliable service delivery, fault management is becoming more significant in all parts of communications networks. However, there is a trade-off between the cost of protection and the level of service reliability. Since economical aspects are most critical in the access part of networks, improving reliability performance by duplication of network resources (and capital expenditures) could be too expensive.

The main contributions of this article include providing a general method for CAPEX and OPEX analysis that can be applied to any type of fiber access network with consideration of changed component cost in time and variable take rates, and comparing the total cost (i.e., sum of CAPEX and OPEX) for the selected representative architectures with and without protection for business and residential users in relation to reliability performance.

      "[\"Energy consumption in optical backbone networks is increasing due to two main reasons: (i) the exponential growth of bandwidth demands, and (ii) the increase in availability requirements in order to guarantee protection of the ultra high capacity optical channels provided by wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks. Although state of the art reliability mechanisms are very efficient in guaranteeing high availability, they do not consider the impact of the protection resources on the network's energy consumption. Dedicated (1:1) path protection (DPP) is a well-known mechanism that provides one extra link-disjoint path for the protection of a connection request. This secondary path is reserved and maintained in an active mode even though it is not utilized most of the time. This means that in-line optical amplifiers and switching nodes/ports are always consuming power even when they are not used to reroute any primary traffic. Moreover secondary paths are on average longer than their respective primary paths. These observations motivated us to investigate the energy savings, when all unused protection resources can be switched into a low-power, stand-by state (or sleep mode) during normal network operation and can be activated upon a failure. It is shown that significant reduction of power consumption (up to 25%) can be achieved by putting protection resources into sleep mode. Moreover, in order to enhance this energy saving figure, this paper proposes and evaluates different energy-efficient algorithms, specifically tailored around the sleep mode option, to dynamically provision 1:1 dedicated path protected connection. The trade-off between energy saving and blocking probability is discussed and an efficient mechanism to overcome this drawback is devised. Our results reveal that a 34% reduction of energy consumption can be obtained with a negligible impact on the network's blocking performance.\"]\n",

In constructing normative scenarios images of the future are generated illustrating potential ways of living, travelling and consuming products and services where certain goals such as a reduced climate impact are fulfilled. This paper argues that tension arising from climate strategies relying on either adaptation or mitigation strategies, or combining the two strategies, warrant further examination. In this paper the inter-relationships between adaptation and mitigation are discussed by examining processes of citizen-participation in constructing scenarios and applying the concepts of resilience, vulnerability and adaptive capacity. We discuss this using the concept of deliberative planning processes as a means to achieve legitimate, effective and sustainable futures. As a part of this approach, we argue that methods for citizen-participation applied in exploring different science and technology options also provide useful insight for this type of planning processes.

Although natural reserves are often seen as preserving 'higher valued' rather than 'lower valued' nature, it is more adequate to describe them as outcomes of selective social articulation processes. This is illustrated in the Stockholm National Urban Park. Despite strong exploitation pressure, a diverse urban movement of civil society organizations has managed to provide narratives able to explain and legitimize the need for protection-a 'protective story'. On the basis of qualitative data and building on theories of value articulation, social movements, and actor-networks, we show how activists, by interlacing artefacts and discourses from cultural history and conservation biology, managed to simultaneously link spatially separated green areas previously seen as disconnected, while also articulating the interrelatedness between the cultural and the natural history of the area. This connective practice constructed holistic values articulating a unified park, which heavily influenced the official framing of the park's values and which now help to explain the success of the movement. In contrast to historically top-down-led designation of natural reserves, we argue that the involvement of civil society in protecting nature (and culture) is on the rise. This nonetheless begs the question of who can participate in these value-creating processes, and we also strive to uncover constraining and facilitating factors for popular participation. Four such factors are suggested: (i) the number and type of artefacts linked to an area; (ii) the capabilities and numbers of activists involved; (iii) the access to social arenas; and (iv) the social network position of actors.\"]\n",

More than 100 million women worldwide are screened every year and early detection of breast cancer through mammography has proven to be a key to significantly reduced mortality. The requirement on spatial resolution as well as contrast resolution is very high in order to detect and diagnose the cancer. Moreover, because of the large number of women going through this procedure and the fact that more than 99 % are healthy, it also becomes very important to minimize the radiation dose. Photon counting may be one way to meet the demands and mammography is the first modality in x-\\x90ray imaging to implement photon counting detectors. FDA approval is still pending but they are currently in routine clinical use in more than 15 countries. The photon counting enables a discrimination of all electronic noise and a more optimum use of the information in each x-\\x90ray. The absence of electronic noise is particularly important in low dose applications, in for example tomosynthesis a number of exposures from different angles are required and since the dose in each projection is just a fraction of the total dose for a mammogram the sensitivity to electronic noise will increase. Using the spectral information for each x-\\x90ray it is in principle possible to deduce the elemental composition of an object in the breast. This could for example be used to enhance microcalcifications relative to soft tissue and differentiate water from fat in cysts. Recently contrast mammography has attracted significant attention. In this application Iodine is used as a contrast media to visualize the vascular structure. As in breast MRI the cancer stand out because of the leaky vessels resulting from its angiogenesis. A photon counting detector gives a unique opportunity to image the Iodine through spectral imaging by adjusting one of the thresholds to its K-\\x90edge. Challenges for photon counting in mammography are high rates of x-\\x90rays, both to generate the required flux at the source and to handle the rates at the detector without pile-\\x90up.

      "['The energy response of plastic scintillators (Eljen Technology EJ-204) to polarized soft gamma-ray photons below 100 keV has been studied, primarily for the balloon-borne polarimeter, PoGOLite. The response calculation includes quenching effects due to low-energy recoil electrons and the position dependence of the light collection efficiency in a 20 cm long scintillator rod. The broadening of the pulse-height spectrum, presumably caused by light transportation processes inside the scintillator, as well as the generation and multiplication of photoelectrons in the photomultiplier tube, were studied experimentally and have also been taken into account. A Monte Carlo simulation based on the Geant4 toolkit was used to model photon interactions in the scintillators. When using the polarized Compton/Rayleigh scattering processes previously corrected by the authors, scintillator spectra and angular distributions of scattered polarized photons could clearly be reproduced, in agreement with the results obtained at a synchrotron beam test conducted at the KEK Photon Factory. Our simulation successfully reproduces the modulation factor, defined as the ratio of the amplitude to the mean of the distribution of the azimuthal scattering angles, within similar to 5% (relative). Although primarily developed for the PoGOLite mission, the method presented here is also relevant for other missions aiming to measure polarization from astronomical objects using plastic scintillator scatterers.']\n",

The instrument used was the auroral imager ASK, situated at Ramfjordmoen, Norway (69.6 N, 19.2 E) on 22 October 2006. Measurements from the European Incoherent Scatter Radar (EISCAT) have been combined with the optical measurements, and incorporated into an ionospheric model to obtain height profiles of electron density and emission rates of the N(2)1P bands. The radar data provide essential verification that the energy flux used in the model is correct. One of the most important inputs to the model is the cross section for excitation to the B-3 Pi(g) electronic state, as well as the cross sections to higher states from which cascading into the B state occurs. The balance equations for production and loss of the populations of all levels in each state are solved in order to find the cascade contributions. Several sets of cross sections have been considered, and selected cross sections have been used to construct \"emission\" cross sections for the observed bands. The resulting brightnesses are compared with those measured by ASK. The importance of specific contributions from cascading is found, with more than 50% of the total brightness resulting from cascading. The cross sections used are found to produce a range of brightnesses well within the uncertainty of both the modelled and measured values.']\n",

The choice of filters for the imagers is discussed, with particular emphasis on the choice of the atomic oxygen line at 777.4 nm as one of the three emissions measured.

In the event chosen, measurements were made from mainland Norway, near Tromso, (69.6 N, 19.2 E). The peak energies of precipitation were between 1-15 keV. In a narrow curling arc, it was found that the arc filaments resulted from energies in excess of 10 keV and fluxes of approximately 7mW/m(2). These filaments of the order of 100 m in width were embedded in a region of lower energies (about 5-10 keV) and fluxes of about 3 mW/m(2).

Users in such environments would instead like to be continuously informed about services relevant to them. Implicit discovery requests triggered by changes in the context are therefore prevalent. This paper proposes a proactiveservice discovery approach for pervasive environments addressing these implicit requests. Services and user preferences are described by a formal context modelcalled Hyperspace Analogue to Context, which effectively captures the dynamics of context and the relationship between services and context. Based on the model, we propose a set of algorithms that can continuously present the most relevant services to the user in response to changes of context, services or user preferences. Numeric coding methods are applied to improve the algorithms-™ performance. The algorithms are grounded in a context-driven service discovery system that automatically reacts to changes in the environment.

This approach has the advantage that large digital screening databases that are becoming available can be used for training. DBT is currently not used for screening which makes it hard to obtain sufficient data for training. Methods: The proposed CAD system is applied to reconstructed DBT volumes and consists of two stages. In the first stage, an existing 2D CAD system is applied to slabs composed of multiple DBT slices, after processing the slabs to a representation similar to that of the FFDM training data. In the second stage, the authors group detections obtained in the slabs that detect the same object and determine the 3D location of the grouped findings using one of three different approaches, including one that uses a set of features extracted from the DBT slabs. Experiments were conducted to determine performance of the CAD system, the optimal slab thickness for this approach and the best method to establish the 3D location. Experiments were performed using a database of 192 patients (752 DBT volumes). In 49 patients, one or more malignancies were present which were described as a mass, architectural distortion, or asymmetry. Free response receiver operating characteristic analysis and bootstrapping were used for statistical evaluation. Results: Best performance was obtained when slab thickness was in the range of 1-2 cm. Using the feature based 3D localization procedure developed in the study, accurate 3D localization could be obtained in most cases. Case sensitivities of 80% and 90% were achieved at 0.35 and 0.99 false positives per volume, respectively.

Early detection of cancer usually results in less extensive treatment and better outcome for the patient. Millimeter wave silicon micromachined waveguide probe is foreseen as an aid for skin diagnosis, which is currently based on visual inspection followed by biopsy, in cases where the macroscopical picture raises suspicion of malignancy. Aims: Demonstration of the discrimination potential of tissues of different water content using a novel micromachined silicon waveguide probe. Secondarily, the silicon probe miniaturization till an inspection area of 600 Á— 200 Î¼m2, representing a drastic reduction by 96.3% of the probing area, in comparison with a conventional WR-10 waveguide. The high planar resolution is required for histology and early-state skin-cancer detection. Material and methods: To evaluate the probe three phantoms with different water contents, i.e. 50%, 75% and 95%, mimicking dielectric properties of human skin were characterized in the frequency range of 95-105 GHz. The complex permittivity values of the skin are obtained from the variation in frequency and amplitude of the reflection coefficient (S11), measured with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), by comparison with finite elements simulations of the measurement set-up, using the commercially available software, HFSS. The expected frequency variation is calculated with HFSS and is based on extrapolated complex permittivities, using one relaxation Debye model from permittivity measurements obtained using the Agilent probe. Results: Millimeter wave reflection measurements were performed using the probe in the frequency range of 95-105 GHz with three phantoms materials and air. Intermediate measurement results are in good agreement with HFSS simulations, based on the extrapolated complex permittivity. The resonance frequency lowers, from the idle situation when it is probing air, respectively by 0.7, 1.2 and 4.26 GHz when a phantom material of 50%, 75% and 95% water content is measured. Discussion: The results of the measurements in our laboratory set-up with three different phantoms indicate that the probe may be able to discriminate between normal and pathological skin tissue, improving the spatial resolution in histology and on skin measurements, due to the highly reduced area of probing. Conclusion: The probe has the potential to discriminate between normal and pathological skin tissue. Further, improved information, compared to the optical histological inspection can be obtained, i.e. the complex permittivity characterization is obtained with a high resolution, due to the highly reduced measurement area of the probe tip.']\n",

The impact on model predictions of physical effects of importance in the SPP mission is also considered by comparing results obtained with and without these effects. Simulation results are presented and compared with increasing levels of complexity in the physics of interaction between solar environment and the SPP spacecraft. The comparisons focus particularly on spacecraft floating potentials, contributions to the currents collected and emitted by the spacecraft, and on the potential and density spatial profiles near the satellite. The physical effects considered include spacecraft charging, photoelectron and secondary electron emission, and the presence of a background magnetic field. Model predictions obtained with our different computational approaches are found to be in agreement within 2% when the same physical processes are taken into account and treated similarly. The comparisons thus indicate that, with the correct description of important physical effects, our simulation models should have the required skill to predict details of satellite-plasma interaction physics under relevant conditions, with a good level of confidence. Our models concur in predicting a negative floating potential V-fl similar to -10V for SPP at perihelion. They also predict a \"saturated emission regime\" whereby most emitted photo-and secondary electron will be reflected by a potential barrier near the surface, back to the spacecraft where they will be recollected.']\n",

The schedule of generating unit output is no longer a staircase function, but a smoother function that respects all ramp constraints.

Input-output analysis generalizes hydrodynamic stability analysis by considering a finite-time horizon over which energy amplification, driven by a specific input (disturbances/actuator) and measured at a specific output (sensor), is observed. In the control design the loop is closed between the output and the input through a feedback gain. Model reduction approximates the system with a low-order model, making modern control design computationally tractable for systems of large dimensions.

In the FCCS measurements, the  fluorescence signal from the predominant emission wavelength range of  the protonated form of the dye is cross-correlated with that of the  deprotonated form. Two lasers are used alternatingly to excite  predominantly the protonated and the deprotonated form of the dye.

The scheme can thus be applied without  concern for the time-scales of the molecular dynamic processes to be  studied.

In field tests, it is difficult to distinguish these particles from others in the surrounding environment, so it is preferable to use laboratory test stands to study the amount of airborne wear particles generated. The purpose of this work is to investigate the possibility of separate, capture, and analyze airborne wear particles generated by a disc brake in a disc brake assembly test stand. This test stand used allows the cleanliness of the air surrounding the test specimens to be controlled and thus the airborne portion of the wear particles to be studied separately. One pair each of low-metallic (LM) and non-asbestos organic (NAO) brake pads was tested against grey cast iron rotors. Before testing, the elemental contents of the brake materials were analyzed using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES). The concentration and size of airborne wear particles were measured online during testing. In addition, airborne wear particles were collected on filters during the tests and afterward analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The analyzed wear particles contained elements such as iron, titanium, zinc, barium, manganese, and copper. Both the low-metallic and non-asbestos organic type of brake pads tested display a bimodal size distribution with peaks at 280 and 350 nm.

      "['In order to develop more durable wheel materials to cope with the new specifications being imposed on wheel wear, a greater understanding of the wear mechanisms and transitions occurring in wheel steels is needed, particularly at higher load and slip conditions. The aim of this work was to draw together current understanding of the wear mechanisms, regimes, and transitions (particularly with R8T wheel material) and new tests on R7T wheel material; to identify gaps in the knowledge; and to develop new tools for assessing wear of wheel materials, such as wear maps, that can be used to improve wear prediction. Wear assessment of wheel materials, as well as wear rates, regimes, and transitions, is discussed. Twin disc wear testing, used extensively for studying wear of wheel and rail materials, has indicated that three wear regimes exist for wheel materials: mild, severe, and catastrophic. These have been classified in terms of wear rate and features. Wear rates are seen to increase steadily initially and then level off, before increasing rapidly as the severity of the contact conditions is increased. Analysis of the contact conditions in terms of friction and slip has indicated that the levelling off of the wear rate observed at the first wear transition is caused by the change from partial slip to full slip conditions at the disc interface. Temperature calculations for the contact showed that the large increase in wear rates seen at the second wear transition may result from a thermally induced reduction in yield strength and other material properties. Comparisons made between discs and actual wheels have provided some support for the theories relating to the transitions observed. Wear maps have been produced using the test results to study how individual contact parameters such as load and sliding speed influence wear rates and transitions. The maps are also correlated to expected wheel-rail contact conditions. This improved understanding of wheel wear mechanisms and transitions will help in the aim of eventually attaining a wear modelling methodology reliant on material properties rather than on wear constants derived from testing.']\n",

In the present study we have investigated the effect of incorporation of a proton transporter, cytochrome c oxidase, into a membrane on the protonation kinetics of a fluorescent pH-sensitive probe attached at the surface of the protein. The results show that proton transfer to the probe was slightly accelerated upon attachment at the protein surface (similar to 7 x 10(10) s(-1) M-1, compared to the expected value of (1-2) x 10(10) s(-1) M-1), which is presumably due to the presence of acidic/His groups in the vicinity. Upon incorporation of the protein into small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles the rate increased by more than a factor of 400 to similar to 3 x 10(13) s(-1) M-1, which indicates that the protein-attached probe is in rapid protonic contact with the membrane surface.

Astroglial cells possess the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that glutamate, acting on group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), increases the permeability of astrocyte AQP4, which, in situations of hypoxia-ischemia, will increase astrocyte water uptake. Here we report that erythropoietin (EPO), which in recent years has emerged as a potent neuro-protective agent, antagonizes the effect of a group I mGluR agonist on astrocyte water permeability. Activation of group I mGluRs triggers fast and highly regular intracellular calcium oscillations and we show that EPO interferes with this signaling event by altering the frequency of the oscillations. These effects of EPO are immediate, in contrast to the neuroprotective effects of EPO that are known to depend upon gene activation. Our findings indicate that EPO may directly reduce the risk of astrocyte swelling in stroke and other brain insults. In support of this conclusion we found that EPO reduced the neurological symptoms in a mouse model of primary brain edema known to depend upon AQP4 water transport.']\n",

These motifs differ in the logic of the feedback loop regulating the uptake of the small molecule.

On the other hand, the negative feedback allows for a rapid initial response, whereas the positive feedback is slower. We also illustrate how the dynamical deficiencies of one feedback motif can be mitigated by an additional loop, while maintaining the original steady-state properties.</p><p>Conclusions: Our analysis emphasizes the core of the regulation found in many motifs at the interface between the metabolic network and the environment of the cell.

Here, we test the hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through canonical transient receptor potential 3 (TRPC3) channels modulates insulin-mediated glucose uptake in adult skeletal muscle. Experiments were performed on adult skeletal muscle cells of wild-type (WT) and obese, insulin-resistant ob/ob mice. Application of the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) induced a nonselective cation current, which was inhibited by the addition of anti-TRPC3 antibody in the patch pipette and smaller in ob/ob than in WT cells. Knockdown of TRPC3, using a novel technique based on small interfering RNA (siRNA) coupled to functionalized carbon nanotubes, resulted in pronounced (similar to 70%) decreases in OAG-induced Ca2+ influx and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. TRPC3 and the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) coimmunoprecipitated, and immunofluorescence staining showed that they were colocalized in the proximity of the transverse tubular system, which is the predominant site of insulin-mediated glucose transport in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, our results indicate that TRPC3 interacts functionally and physically with GLUT4, and Ca2+ influx through TRPC3 modulates insulin-mediated glucose uptake.

We investigated possible adaptive aspects of such cross-generation transmissions, and hypothesized that chronic unpredictable food access would cause chickens to show a more conservative feeding strategy and to be more dominant, and that these adaptations would be transmitted to the offspring. Methodology/Principal Findings: Parents were raised in an unpredictable (UL) or in predictable diurnal light rhythm (PL, 12:12 h light: dark). In a foraging test, UL birds pecked more at freely available, rather than at hidden and more attractive food, compared to birds from the PL group. Female offspring of UL birds, raised in predictable light conditions without parental contact, showed a similar foraging behavior, differing from offspring of PL birds. Furthermore, adult offspring of UL birds performed more food pecks in a dominance test, showed a higher preference for high energy food, survived better, and were heavier than offspring of PL parents. Using cDNA microarrays, we found that the differential brain gene expression caused by the challenge was mirrored in the offspring. In particular, several immunoglobulin genes seemed to be affected similarly in both UL parents and their offspring. Estradiol levels were significantly higher in egg yolk from UL birds, suggesting one possible mechanism for these effects. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that unpredictable food access caused seemingly adaptive responses in feeding behavior, which may have been transmitted to the offspring by means of epigenetic mechanisms, including regulation of immune genes.

As the agent of the Irish potato famine in the mid-nineteenth century, P. infestans has had a tremendous effect on human history, resulting in famine and population displacement(1). To this day, it affects world agriculture by causing the most destructive disease of potato, the fourth largest food crop and a critical alternative to the major cereal crops for feeding the world's population(1). Current annual worldwide potato crop losses due to late blight are conservatively estimated at $6.7 billion(2). Management of this devastating pathogen is challenged by its remarkable speed of adaptation to control strategies such as genetically resistant cultivars(3,4). Here we report the sequence of the P. infestans genome, which at similar to 240 megabases (Mb) is by far the largest and most complex genome sequenced so far in the chromalveolates. Its expansion results from a proliferation of repetitive DNA accounting for similar to 74% of the genome. Comparison with two other Phytophthora genomes showed rapid turnover and extensive expansion of specific families of secreted disease effector proteins, including many genes that are induced during infection or are predicted to have activities that alter host physiology. These fast-evolving effector genes are localized to highly dynamic and expanded regions of the P. infestans genome. This probably plays a crucial part in the rapid adaptability of the pathogen to host plants and underpins its evolutionary potential.\"]\n",

The chelator sequence SECG (serine-glutamic acid-cysteine-glycine) was anchored on the C-terminal to allow Tc-99m labelling. The cysteine can alternatively serve as a conjugation site of the chelator DOTA for indium labelling. The resulting Tc-99m- and In-111-labelled Affibody molecules were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Both conjugates retained their capacity to bind to HER2 receptors in vitro and in vivo. The tumour to blood ratio in LS174T xenografts was 30 at 4 h post-injection for both conjugates. Biodistribution data showed that the Tc-99m-labelled Affibody molecule had a fourfold lower kidney accumulation compared with the In-111-labelled Affibody molecule while the accumulation in other organs was similar. Gamma camera imaging of the conjugates could clearly visualise the tumours 4 h after injection. Incorporation of the C-terminal SECG sequence in Affibody molecules provides a general multifunctional platform for site-specific labelling with different nuclides (technetium, indium, gallium, cobalt or yttrium) and for a flexible production (chemical synthesis or recombinant).']\n",

The aim of this study was to evaluate if optimization of the injected protein dose might improve imaging of EGFR expression in tumours using a novel EGFR-targeting protein, the DOTA-Z(EGFR:2377) Affibody molecule. An anti-EGFR Affibody molecule, Z(EGFR:2377), was labelled with In-111 via the DOTA chelator site-specifically conjugated to a C-terminal cysteine. The affinity of DOTA-Z(EGFR:2377) for murine and human EGFR was measured by surface plasmon resonance. The cellular processing of In-111-DOTA-Z(EGFR:2377) was evaluated in vitro. The biodistribution of radiolabelled Affibody molecules injected in a broad range of injected Affibody protein doses was evaluated in mice bearing EGFR-expressing A431 xenografts. Site-specific coupling of DOTA provided a uniform conjugate possessing equal affinity for human and murine EGFR. The internalization of In-111-DOTA-Z(EGFR:2377) by A431 cells was slow. In vivo, the conjugate accumulated specifically in xenografts and in EGFR-expressing tissues. The curve representing the dependence of tumour uptake on the injected Affibody protein dose was bell-shaped. The highest specific radioactivity (lowest injected protein dose) provided a suboptimal tumour-to-blood ratio. The results of the biodistribution study were confirmed by gamma-camera imaging.

Amino acid extensions either at the N- or C-terminus of these Z(HER2) affibody molecules, have been successfully employed for site-specific radiolabeling of the tracer candidates. Hexahistidyls or other tags, which would be convenient for recovery purposes, should be avoided since they could negatively influence the tumor targeting efficacy and biodistribution properties of the tracer.

This suggests that the interacting area include the HER2-binding surface of Z(HER2). This novel anti-idiotypic affibody molecule Z(E01) was produced in Escherichia coli, purified, and chemically coupled to a chromatography resin in order to generate an affibody-based affinity column, suitable for recovery of different variants of Z(HER2) affibody molecules, having a common binding surface for HER2. Eight such Z(HER2) affibody molecules, designed for future radioimaging investigations, having different C-terminal peptide extensions aimed for radioisotope (Tc-99m)-chelation, were successfully produced and recovered in a single step to high purity using the anti-idiotypic affibody ligand for the affinity purification.

The small size (7 kDa) and subnanomolar affinity of Affibody molecules enables high-contrast imaging of tumor-associated molecular targets, particularly human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2). Tc-99m as a label offers advantages in clinical practice, and earlier studies demonstrated that Tc-99m-labeled recombinant Affibody molecules with a C-terminal cysteine could be used for HER2 imaging. However, the renal retention of radioactivity exceeded tumor uptake, which might complicate imaging of metastases in the lumbar region. The aim of this study was to develop an agent with low renal uptake and preserved tumor targeting. Methods: A series of recombinant derivatives of the HER2-binding Z(HER2:342) Affibody molecule with a C-terminal chelating sequence, -GXXC (X denoting glycine, serine, lysine, or glutamate), was designed. The constructs were labeled with Tc-99m and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: All variants were stably labeled with Tc-99m, with preserved capacity to bind specifically to HER2-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. The composition of the chelating sequence had a clear influence on the cellular processing and biodistribution properties of the Affibody molecules. The best variant, Tc-99m-Z(HER2:V2), with the C-terminal chelating sequence -GGGC, provided the lowest radioactivity retention in all normal organs and tissues including the kidneys. Tc-99m-Z(HER2:V2) displayed high uptake of radioactivity in HER2-expressing xenografts, 22.6 +/- 4.0 and 7.7 +/- 1.5 percentage injected activity per gram of tissue at 4 h after injection in SKOV-3 (high HER2 expression) and DU-145 (low HER2 expression) tumors, respectively. In both models, the tumor uptake exceeded the renal uptake. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the biodistribution properties of recombinant Tc-99m-labeled Affibody molecules can be optimized by modification of the C-terminal cysteine-containing chelating sequence. Tc-99m-Z(HER2:V2) is a promising candidate for further development as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for imaging of HER2-expressing tumors. These results may be useful for the development of imaging agents based on other Affibody molecules and, hopefully, other scaffolds.']\n",

      "['Expressions for the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and activity coefficients as functions of surfactant composition in mixtures of two identically charged monovalent ionic surfactants are derived from the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory. For the special case of no added salt, the simple expression cmc(alpha) = xcmc(1)(alpha) + (1 - x)cmc(2)(alpha) is deduced, where the exponential parameter alpha &gt; 1 depends on the number of ionic species in a surfactant molecule as well as the curvature of the self-assembled interface. Theoretical predictions are compared with cmc values obtained with some different experimental techniques for mixtures of the two cationic surfactants didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) in water and in the absence of added salt. It is demonstrated that the PB theory generates significantly better agreement with experimental data than predicted by ideal behaviour or the regular mixture theory. We find that maximum synergistic effects occur at a DDAB mole fraction in solution y = 0.005. According to the PB theory, this very low value of y corresponds to a mole fraction of DDAB in the self-assembled interfacial aggregates equal to x = 0.995. Moreover, our calculations of the surfactant composition in the self-assembled interfacial aggregates above cmc demonstrate that the transition from small micelles to large bilayer aggregates is found to consistently occur at a mole fraction of DDAB equal to about x = 0.41-0.42, irrespective of the surfactant molar ratio in solution. Experimental observations strongly support the fact that concentrations of free surfactant, as well as the surfactant composition in the self-assembled interfacial aggregates, may be accurately calculated from the non-linear Poison-Boltzmann theory. On the other hand, a micelle-to-bilayer transition induced by changes in surfactant mole fraction in the self-assembled interfacial aggregates is consistent with neither ideal surfactant behaviour nor synergistic behaviour according to the regular mixture theory.']\n",

Small oblate spheroidal micelles formed by DTAB grow with respect to width and length to form mixed ellipsoidal tablet-shaped micelles as an increasing fraction of DDAB is admixed into the micelles. The growth behaviour of the micelles is rationalized from the general micelle model in terms of three bending elasticity constants spontaneous curvature (H(0)), bending rigidity (k(c)) and saddle-splay constant ((k(c)) over bar kc). It is found that micelles grow with respect to width, mainly as a result of decreasing k(c)H(0), and in the length direction as a result of decreasing k(c). The micelles are still rather small, i.e. about 140 angstrom in length, as an abrupt transition to large bilayer aggregates is observed. The micelle-to-bilayer transition is induced by changes in aggregate composition and is observed to occur at a mole fraction of DDAB equal to about x = 0.48 in D(2)O, which is a significantly higher value than previously observed for the same system in H(2)O (x = 0.41). An abrupt micelle-to-bilayer transition is in agreement with predictions from the general micelle model, according to which an abrupt transition from micelles to bilayers is expected to occur at xi H(0) = 1/4, where x is the thickness of the self-assembled interface, and we may conclude that H(0)(D(2)O) &gt; H(0)(H(2)O) for the system DDAB/DTAB in absence of added salt.

As a result, our present investigation suggests a never before reported structural behavior of Gemini surfactant micelles, according to which micelles transform from elongated ellipsoids to nonelongated oblate spheroids as the length of the spacer group is increased. The aggregation number of oblate micelles is observed to monotonously decrease with an increasing length of the surfactant spacer group, mainly as a result of a decreasing minor half axis (a), whereas the major half axis (b) is rather constant with respect to s. We argue that geometrically heterogeneous elongated micelles are formed by dimeric surfactants with a short spacer group mainly as a result of the surface charges becoming less uniformly distributed over the micelle interface. As the length of the spacer group increases, the distance between intramolecular charges become approximately equal to the average distance between charges on the micelle interface, and as a result, rather small oblate spheroidal micelles with a more uniform distribution of surface charges are formed by dimeric 12-s-12 surfactants with 6 &lt;= s &lt;= 12.']\n",

Although probabilistic methods for phylogenetic inference have been around for decades, probabilistic reconciliation methods are far less established. Based on our model, we have implemented a Bayesian analysis tool, PrIME-GSR, for gene tree inference that takes a known species tree into account. Our implementation is sound and we demonstrate its utility for genomewide gene-family analysis by applying it to recently presented yeast data. We validate PrIME-GSR by comparing with previous analyses of these data that take advantage of gene order information. In a case study we apply our method to the ADH gene family and are able to draw biologically relevant conclusions concerning gene duplications creating key yeast phenotypes.

The NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) has provided digital elevation models (DEM) for over 80% of the land surface on earth. The latest version 3.0 SRTM data provided by the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research-Consortium for Spatial Information GeoPortal is the result of substantial editing effort on the SRTM digital elevation data produced by NASA. Easy availability of SRTM 3 arc second data has resulted in great advances in morphometric studies and numerical description of terrain surface features as shown by many literature references. The first derivative, slope steepness and second derivatives, minimum curvature, maximum curvature and cross-sectional curvature of elevation were derived by fitting bivariate quadratic surfaces with nine window sizes ranging from 5 to 55 cells to the processed SRTM DEM 90 m Version 3.0. These analyses represent landform entities with ground distances from 450 to 4950 m, which are local to regional features. The four morphometric parameters were used as input for the SOM algorithm. Forty-two SOMs with different learning parameter sets, e.g. initial radius, final radius and number of iterations were investigated. An optimal SOM with 10 classes based on 1000 iteration and a final neighbourhood radius of 0.01 provide a low average quantization error of 0.1780 and was used for further analysis.

      "[\"The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle is a versatile tool for statistical inference of the probability density function (pdf) from its moments as a least-biased estimation among all other possible pdfs. It maximizes Shannon entropy, satisfying the moment constraints. Thus, the MaxEnt algorithm transforms the original constrained optimization problem to the unconstrained dual optimization problem using Lagrangian multipliers. The Classic Moment Problem (CMP) uses algebraic power moments, causing typical conventional numerical methods to fail for higher-order moments (m &gt; 5-10) due to different sensitivities of Lagrangian multipliers and unbalanced nonlinearities. Classic MaxEnt algorithms overcome these difficulties by using orthogonal polynomials, which enable roughly the same sensitivity for all Lagrangian multipliers. In this paper, we employ an idea based on different principles, using Fup(n) basis functions with compact support, which can exactly describe algebraic polynomials, but only if the Fup order-n is greater than or equal to the polynomial's order. Our algorithm solves the CMP with respect to the moments of only low order Fup(2) basis functions, finding a Fup(2) optimal pdf with better balanced Lagrangian multipliers. The algorithm is numerically very efficient due to localized properties of Fup(2) basis functions implying a weaker dependence between Lagrangian multipliers and faster convergence. Only consequences are an iterative scheme of the algorithm where power moments are a sum of Fup(2) and residual moments and an inexact entropy upper bound. However, due to small residual moments, the algorithm converges very quickly as demonstrated on two continuous pdf examples - the beta distribution and a bi-modal pdf, and two discontinuous pdf examples - the step and double Dirac pdf. Finally, these pdf examples present that Fup MaxEnt algorithm yields smaller entropy value than classic MaxEnt algorithm, but differences are very small for all practical engineering purposes.\"]\n",

In this study, we investigate the importance of visual cues for inversion. Experiments with motion capture data of the face show that important articulatory information can be extracted using only a few face measures that mimic the information that could be gained from a video-based method. We also show that the depth cue for these measures is not critical, which means that the relevant information can be extracted from a frontal video. A real video-based face feature extraction method is further presented, leading to similar improvements in inversion quality. Rather than tracking points on the face, it represents the appearance of the mouth area using independent component images.

The general theory is applied to fullerene C-60 because of its good optical limiting properties, namely, a rather low ground state absorption and a strong triplet-triplet absorption. It is shown that sequential absorption involving strong triplet-triplet transitions is the major mechanism of nonlinear absorption. The intrinsic hierarchy of time scales makes an adiabatic solution of the coupled rate equations valid, which therefore can be reduced to a single dynamical equation for the ground state population. The slow evolution of this population is defined by an effective rate of population transfer to the triplet state and by the pulse duration. The propagation effect plays an important role in the optical power limiting performance. The intensity of the field as well as the population of the triplet state decreases during the pulse propagation, and a weakened nonlinear sequential two-photon absorption is followed by a linear one-photon absorption which gradually becomes the dominating process. The competition between these qualitatively different processes depends on the field intensity, the length of the absorber, and the concentration. The pulse propagation is studied by solving numerically the two-dimensional paraxial field equation together with the effective rate equation for the ground state population.']\n",

Possible existence of knotted solitons in multicomponent superconductors was predicted several years ago. However, their basic properties and stability in these systems remain an outstandingly difficult question both for analytical and numerical treatment. Here I propose a special perturbative approach to treat self-consistently all the degrees of freedom in the problem. I show that there exists a length scale for a Hopfion texture where the electrodynamics of a two-component superconductor is dominated by a self-induced Faddeev term, which is in stark contrast to the Meissner electrodynamics of single-component systems. I also show that at certain short length scales knotted solitons in the two-component Ginzburg-Landau model are not described by a Faddeev-Skyrme-type model and are unstable. However, these solitons can be stable at some intermediate length scales. I argue that configurations with high topological charge may be more stable in these systems than low-charge configurations. In the second part of the paper I discuss qualitatively different physics of the stability of knotted solitons in a more general Ginzburg-Landau model and point out the physically relevant terms which enhance or suppress the stability of knotted solitons. With this argument it is demonstrated that Ginzburg-Landau models possess stable knotted solitons.']\n",

An open-shell neutral conjugated system, the CAN radical in the doublet X(2)A(2), quartet X(4)A(2), and sextet X(6)A(1) states, is chosen as a model system to illustrate various aspects of the theory. It is found that irrespective of the exchange-correlation functional employed, the components of the polarizability alpha(-omega,omega) and first hyperpolarizability beta(-2(omega,omega,omega) show very different dependency with respect to the multiplicity, with an increasing trend for higher spin states. This is rationalized by the decrease in conjugation and stability of the system with increasing multiplicity, and by the way the interaction between unpaired electrons and the external field is shielded by remaining electrons of the molecule. The study suggests the applicability of open-shell systems for frequency-dependent nonlinear optical properties and for the possibility of spin control for such properties.']\n",

      "['The transient start problem of a rolling cylindrical contact has been studied. The transient conditions were controlled by the applied relative slip. Two cases with start of rolling from stationary contact were investigated, with constant and with linearly increasing applied slip. At each instant during the transition stage, it was assumed that the traction distribution could be approximated with the Carter traction for steady-state tractive rolling. Based on this distribution, approximate expressions were derived for the transient rolling distance and transient behaviour of the tangential load. The transient period could end in gross sliding or steady-state creep with the Carter traction distribution and stick-slip regions in the contact. The expressions and the transient traction distributions were validated numerically using FEM. Simulations with constant applied slip showed that when rolling started from a tangentially unloaded and unstrained position, the steady-state traction distribution by Carter was a good approximation of the actual transient traction distribution. The solution was accurate for transient rolling lengths longer than a quarter of the contact width. The transient behaviour depended on the bulk geometry of the structures. For the relatively stiff structure with two elastic steel cylinders, small amounts of relative slip and high coefficients of friction, the transient rolling distance, L-0, could become large. In the present study, examples with L-0 approximate to 40 . a were identified. Thus, situations exist for which the transient conditions might be important. The transient distance increased with smaller slip, larger coefficient of friction, lower bulk stiffness, higher contact normal loads and for more compliant materials. The spur gear contact interaction with varying slip was considered as a case study.']\n",

However, presence of liquid water in a snowpack is known to decrease the radar wave velocity, which for a typical snowpack with 5% (by volume) liquid water can lead to an overestimation of SWE by about 20%. It would therefore be beneficial if radar measurements could also be used to determine snow wetness. Our approach is to use radar wave attenuation in the snowpack, which depends on electrical properties of snow (permittivity and conductivity) which in turn depend on snow wetness. The relationship between radar wave attenuation and these electrical properties can be derived theoretically, while the relationship between electrical permittivity and snow wetness follows a known empirical formula, which also includes snow density. Snow wetness can therefore be determined from radar wave attenuation if the relationship between electrical conductivity and snow wetness is also known. In a laboratory test, three sets of measurements were made on initially dry 1m thick snowpacks. Snow wetness was controlled by stepwise addition of water between radar measurements, and a linear relationship between electrical conductivity and snow wetness was established.']\n",

This is also a source of broadband-conducted and radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) for vehicle as well as traction power and signaling systems. In this paper and the companion paper, experimental analyses of pantograph arcing phenomena are presented for dc and ac feeding systems, respectively. Influences of different parameters on dc traction system, such as supply-voltage polarity, relative motion between pantograph and overhead contact wire, namely, forward motion along the track (longitudinal), and lateral sliding motion of the pantograph (zigzag) are presented here. From the voltage and current waveforms of the test runs, it is shown that pantograph arcing is a polarity-dependent phenomenon. For the positive-fed overhead traction system, where pantograph is cathode, the supply interruptions due to zigzag motion are comparatively less compared to negatively fed traction systems. As a result, the transients, due to pantograph arcing, are more frequent in negatively fed traction systems. It is found that the arc root movement along the electrode surfaces (pantograph-contact wire) is governed by the relative motion and polarity of the electrodes. The analyses presented in this paper also form a foundation to understand the pantograph arcing process and the corresponding influential parameters with the ac supply presented in the companion paper. The findings presented in this paper could be beneficial for coming up with appropriate mitigation techniques from the EMI due to pantograph arcing in dc-fed traction systems.']\n",

The asymmetry generates a net dc component and harmonics, which propagate within the traction power and signalling system and causes electromagnetic interference.

In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms of sliding contact and arcing between pantograph-contact wire using the experimental setup described in Part I. Influences of various parameters and test conditions on arcing phenomenon and their signature patterns on the supply voltage and current waveforms are presented. It is shown how the arcing mechanism and corresponding asymmetry in the voltage and current waveforms are governed by line speed, current, supply voltage, inductive load, and pantograph material. The asymmetry in the current waveform is mainly due to the difference in the duration of successive zero-current regions and uneven distortion of the waveshapes. This, in turn, creates the asymmetry in the voltage waveform.

Plasminogen activator, a serine protease that regulates blood coagulation, is known to be expressed in the saliva of Desmodus rotundus (common vampire bat) and is thought to be a key enzyme for the emergence of blood feeding in vampire bats. To better understand the evolution of this biological function, we studied the plasminogen activator (PA) genes from all vampire bat species in light of their feeding transition to bird and subsequently mammalian blood. We include the rare species Diphylla ecaudata and Diaemus youngi, where plasminogen activator had not previously been studied and demonstrate that PA gene duplication observed in Desmodus is not essential to the vampire phenotype, but relates to the emergence of predominant mammalian blood feeding in this species. Plasminogen activator has evolved through gene duplication, domain loss, and sequence evolution leading to change in fibrin-specificity and susceptibility to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Before undertaking this study, only the four plasminogen activator isoforms from Desmodus were known. The evolution of vampire bat plasminogen activators can now be linked phylogenetically to the transition in feeding behavior among vampire bat species from bird to mammalian blood.']\n",

This report sheds light on the lipid environment of the (1 -&gt; 3)-beta-D-glucan and chitin synthases, as well as on the sterol biosynthetic pathways in oomycetes. The results presented here are consistent with a function of lipid rafts in cell polarization and as platforms for sorting specific sets of proteins targeted to the plasma membrane, such as carbohydrate synthases.

As for animal cells, a large range of cellular functions, such as signal transduction, endocytosis and protein trafficking, have been attributed to plant lipid rafts and DRMs. The data available are essentially based on protcomics and more approaches need to be undertaken to elucidate the precise function of individual populations of DRMs in plants. We report here the first isolation of DRMs from purified plasma membranes of a tree species, the hybrid aspen Populus tremula x tremuloides, and their biochemical characterization. Plasma membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100 and the resulting DRMs were isolated by flotation in sucrose density gradients. The DRMs were enriched in sterols, sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and thus exhibited similar properties to DRMs from other species. However, they contained key carbohydrate synthases involved in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis, namely callose [(1 -&gt; 3)-beta-D-glucan] and cellulose synthases. The association of these enzymes with DRMs was demonstrated using specific glucan synthase assays and antibodies, as well as biochemical and chemical approaches for the characterization of the polysaccharides synthesized in vitro by the isolated DRMs. More than 70% of the total glucan synthase activities present in the original plasma membranes was associated with the DRM fraction. In addition to shedding light on the lipid environment of callose and cellulose synthases, our results demonstrate the involvement of DRMs in the biosynthesis of important cell wall polysaccharides.

The corresponding protoplasts regenerating a cell wall exhibited a higher rate of beta-glucan synthesis and cellulose deposition was increased in the walls of the transgenic cells. A higher level of plasma membrane glucan synthase activities was also measured in detergent extracts of membrane fractions from the transgenic line, while no activation of Golgi-bound glycan synthases was detected.

The data showed that the glucans consisted of callose and cellulose and that the amount of each glucan synthesized by the enzyme preparation from the transgenic cells was significantly higher than in the case of the wildtype cells. The demonstration that callose and cellulose synthases are activated in cells overexpressing the wall-bound phosphatase NtPAP12 suggests a regulation of these carbohydrate synthases by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process, as well as a role of wall-bound phosphatases in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis.']\n",

To exemplify the potential of fluorogenic resorufin glycosides to address this issue, a resorufin beta-glycoside of a xylogluco-oligosaccharide (XXXG-beta-Res) was synthesized as a specific substrate for in planta analysis of XEH activity. The resorufin aglycone is particularly distinguished for high sensitivity in muro assays due to a low pK(a) (5.8) and large extinction coefficient (epsilon 62,000 M-1 cm(-1)), long-wavelength fluorescence (excitation 571 nm/emission 585 nm), and high quantum yield (0.74) of the corresponding anion. In vitro analyses demonstrated that XXXG-beta-Res is hydrolyzed by the archetypal plant XEH, nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) NXG1, with classical Michaelis-Menten substrate saturation kinetics and a linear dependence on both enzyme concentration and incubation time. Further, XEH activity could be visualized in real time by observing the localized increase in fluorescence in germinating nasturtium seeds and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) inflorescent stems by confocal microscopy. Importantly, this new in situ XEH assay provides an essential complement to the in situ xyloglucan endotransglycosylase assay, thus allowing delineation of the disparate activities encoded by xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase genes directly in plant tissues. The observation that XXXG-beta-Res is also hydrolyzed by diverse microbial XEHs indicates that this substrate, and resorufin glycosides in general, may find broad applicability for the analysis of wall restructuring by polysaccharide hydrolases during morphogenesis and plant-microbe interactions.']\n",

Furthermore, they were nontoxic to primary human monocyte-derived macrophages at all doses tested whereas dose-dependent toxicity of the smaller silica-coated nanoparticles (30 nm and 50 nm) was observed for primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but not for the similarly small dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. No macrophage or dendritic cell secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed upon administration of nanoparticles. The silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were taken up to a significantly higher degree when compared to the dextran-coated nanoparticles, irrespective of size. Cellular internalization of the silica-coated nanoparticles was through an active, actin cytoskeleton-dependent process. We conclude that these novel silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles are promising materials for medical imaging, cell tracking and other biomedical applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This allowed the assessment of both mechanical and swelling properties for a wide range of novel hydrogels ranging from loosely crosslinked SeqIPN 8-8 to densely crosslinked SeqIPN 2-2 systems.

The impact of diffusion time on loosely crosslinked S8 network with a swelling degree of 970% and tensile modulus of 175 kPa displayed a significant change in the final properties. For instance, a 2 h diffusion of 2 kDa PEG precursors generated a SeqIPN 8-2:2 comprising a secondary network solid content of 34% with a water swelling degree 580% and a tensile modulus of 365 kPa. On saturation, that is, 44 h of diffusion, SeqIPN 2-8:44 exhibited 64% of secondary network solid content, a swelling capacity of 380% and over fourfold of tensile modulus (758 kPa) when compared with the primary network S8. SeqIPN hydrogel with the highest tensile modulus and lowest degree of water swelling was obtained after 44 h diffusion of 2 kDa PEG precursors within the densely crosslinked S2 primary network. In this case, SeqIPN 2-2:44 noted a water swelling capability of 280% and a tensile modulus over 1 MPa. The latter was twofold when compared with S2 with a tensile modulus of 555 kPa.

      "['Particulate debris beds may form during different stages of a severe core melt accident; e.g. in the degrading hot core, due to thermal stresses during reflooding, in the lower plenum, by melt flow from the core into water in the lower head, and in the cavity by melt flow out of a failing RPV into a wet cavity. Deep water pools in the cavity are used in Nordic BWRs as an accident management measure aiming at particulate debris formation and coolability. It has been elaborated in the joint work of the European Severe Accident Research Network (SARNET) in Work Package (WP) 11.1 that coolability of particulate debris, reflooding of hot debris as well as boil-off under decay heat (long-term coolability), is strongly favoured by 2D/3D effects in beds with non-homogeneous structure and shape. Especially, water inflow from the sides and via bottom regions strongly improves coolability as compared to 1D situations with top flooding, the latter being in the past the basis of analyses on coolability. Data from experiments included in the SARNET network (DEBRIS at IKE and STYX at VTT) and earlier ones (e.g. POMECO at KTH) have been used to validate key constitutive laws in 2D codes as WABE (IKE) and ICARE/CATHARE (IRSN), especially concerning flow friction and heat transfer. Major questions concern the need of the explicit use of interfacial friction to adequately treat the various flow situations in a unified approach, as well as the adequate characterization of realistic debris composed of irregularly shaped particles of different sizes. joint work has been supported by transfer of the WABE code to KTH and VTT. Concerning realistic debris, the formation from breakup of melt jets in water is investigated in the DEFOR experiments at KTH. Present results indicate that porosities in the debris might be much higher than previously assumed, which would strongly support attainment of coolability. Calculations have been performed with IKEJET/IKEMIX describing jet breakup, mixing and settling of resulting particles. Models about debris bed formation and porosity are developed at KTH. The codes have been applied to reactor conditions for analysing the potential for coolability in the different phases of a severe accident. Calculations have been performed with WABE (MEWA) implemented in ATHLET-CD and with ICARE/ICATHARE for degraded cores and debris beds in the lower plenum, under reflooding and boil-off. Ex-vessel situations have also been analysed. Strong effects of lateral water inflow and cooling by steam in hot areas have been demonstrated. In support, some typical basic configurations have been analysed, e.g. configurations with downcomers considered as possible AM measures. Melt pool formation or coolability of particulate debris is a major issue concerning melt retention in the core and the lower head.

      "['The development of a corium pool in the lower head and its behaviour is still a critical issue. This concerns, in general, the understanding of a severe accident with core melting, its course, major critical phases and timing, and the influence of these processes on the accident progression as well as, in particular, the evaluation of in-vessel melt retention by external vessel flooding as an accident mitigation strategy. Previous studies were especially related to the in-vessel retention question and often just concentrated on the quasi-steady state behaviour of a large molten pool in the lower head, considered as a bounding configuration. However, non-feasibility of the in-vessel retention concept for high power density reactors and uncertainties e.g. due to layering effects even for low or medium power reactors, turns this to be insufficient. Rather, it is essential to consider the whole evolution of the accident, including e.g. formation and growth of the in-core melt pool, characteristics of corium arrival in the lower head, and molten pool behaviour after the debris re-melting. These phenomena have a strong impact on a potential termination of a severe accident. The general objective of the LIVE program at FZK is to study these phenomena resulting from core melting experimentally in large-scale 3D geometry and in supporting separate-effects tests, with emphasis on the transient behaviour. Up to now, several tests on molten pool behaviour have been performed within the LIVE experimental program with water and with non-eutectic melts (KNO3-NaNO3) as simulant fluids. The results of these experiments, performed in nearly adiabatic and in isothermal conditions, allow a direct comparison with findings obtained earlier in other experimental programs (SIMECO, ACOPO, BALI, etc.) and will be used for the assessment of the correlations derived for the molten pool behaviour. Complementary to other international programs with real corium melts, the results of the LIVE activities also provide data for a better understanding of in-core corium pool behaviour. The experimental results are being used for the development and validation of mechanistic models for the description of molten pool behaviour, In the present paper, a range of different models is used for post-test calculations and comparative analyses. This includes simplified, but fast running models implemented in the severe accident codes ASTEC and ATHLET-CD. Further, a computational tool developed at KTH (PECM model implemented in Fluent) is applied.

However, different modes of vessel failure may result in different regimes of melt release from the vessel, which determine initial conditions for melt coolant interaction and eventually coolability of the debris bed. The goal of this study is to define if retention of decay-heated melt inside the reactor pressure vessel is possible and investigate modes of the vessel wall failure otherwise. The mode of failure is contingent upon the ultimate mechanical strength of the vessel structures under given mechanical and thermal loads and applied cooling measures. The influence of pool depth and respective transient thermal loads on the reactor vessel failure mode is studied with coupled thermo-mechanical creep analysis. Efficacy of control rod guide tube (CRGT) cooling and external vessel wall cooling as potential severe accident management measures is investigated.

      "['Cold compaction of composite powders has been analyzed using a discrete element method (DEM). Powder aggregates consisting of up to approximately 10,000 particles and formed by two powder populations with known material strength and size ratios have been compacted both isostatically and uniaxially (die compaction). The particles were assumed constitutively to be perfectly plastic or rigid and as a result, local contacts between the particles were described by a linear force-displacement relation given by previous in-depth analyses of spherical indentation problems. Particular emphasis has been placed on investigating the particle contact evolution at die compaction and to compare the results with previous ones pertinent to the isostatic case. Consequently, the predictive capability of the fundamental assumptions frequently used in theoretical analyses of compaction problems is determined for a uniaxial situation. The main conclusion is that size ratio effects are substantial at die compaction and when such features are present, theoretical predictions overestimates the (average) number of contacts per particle. It was also found that the mechanical behaviors at isostatic and die compaction are very similar even though die compaction values are slightly higher at high values on the relative density of powder materials.']\n",

Despite the studies undertaken by numerous local researchers, and the identification of proven treatment methods for the specific water conditions encountered, no technologies have been commercialized due to a current lack of funding and technical assistance. Emerging, low-cost technologies to mitigate the problem of arsenic in drinking water resources that are suitable for rural and urban areas lacking centralized water supplies have been evaluated. The technologies generally use simple and low-cost equipment that can easily be handled and maintained by the local population. Experiences comprise (i) coagulation/filtration with iron and aluminum salts, scaled-down for small community-and household-scale-applications, (ii) adsorption techniques using low-cost arsenic sorbents, such as geological materials (clays, laterites, soils, limestones), natural organic-based sorbents (natural biomass), and synthetic materials.

The formation energies are calculated to be lower for the austenite than for the ferrite, meaning that the configurational entropy has a more significant impact on the stability field of the austenitic phase. The magnetic and vibrational free energies have opposite effects on the phase stability. Namely, the magnetic entropy favors the ferrite phase, whereas the vibrational free energy stabilizes the austenite phase. Combining the formation energies with the magnetic, vibrational, and configurational free energies, a region of coexistence between the two phases is obtained, in line with former thermodynamic assessments as well as with experimental observations.']\n",

To do this, one needs to reduce the information, lists of chemical reactions, available in databases. Even for the simplest type of graph representation, this reduction can be done in several ways. We investigate different simple network representations by testing how well they encode information about one biologically important network structure-network modularity (the propensity for edges to be clustered into dense groups that are sparsely connected between each other). To achieve this goal, we design a model of reaction systems where network modularity can be controlled and measure how well the reduction to simple graphs captures the modular structure of the model reaction system. We find that the network types that best capture the modular structure of the reaction system are substrate-product networks (where substrates are linked to products of a reaction) and substance networks (with edges between all substances participating in a reaction). Furthermore, we argue that the proposed model for reaction systems with tunable clustering is a general framework for studies of how reaction systems are affected by modularity. To this end, we investigate statistical properties of the model and find, among other things, that it recreates correlations between degree and mass of the molecules.']\n",

Generally, an 8:1:1 split is the most common in machine learning of this data size. However, since semi-supervised learning is adopted, and the test accuracy will be used as a threshold for reject/accept of unlabeled data, hence, the test set must not be biased. One of the easiest ways to avoid bias, in this case, is to have a larger test-sample."
